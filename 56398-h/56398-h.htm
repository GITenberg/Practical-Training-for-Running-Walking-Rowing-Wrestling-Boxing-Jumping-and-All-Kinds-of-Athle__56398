<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>

<p>Notwithstanding that so many books have been written on <span class="smcap">Physical
Culture</span>, there still remained a large field to be covered&mdash;hence the
publication of the present volume. Great care having been taken
in its compilation, we feel confident that the work will be in every
sense of the word practical; so that those who desire may follow
whatever their fancy prefers in athletic sports, in a creditable manner.
In our opinion, the general usefulness of the book could in no way
be improved upon; but, in order to be thoroughly posted in the laws
governing athletic contests, the “<span class="smcap">Manual of Sporting Rules</span>,” as
a companion to this work, will be found very beneficial. The table
of Proportional Measurements, according to height and weight, will
form a good guide for the athlete as to his special muscular development.
Banting’s System of Reducing Corpulency, though not exactly
intended for training purposes, is not to be despised, containing, as
it does, much interesting and reliable information, on the subject of
diet especially. To complete the treatise, and in order to prove
what can be done by man when in proper physical condition, we
add a record of the best athletic performances.

<h2 class="xx-large">PRACTICAL TRAINING.</h2>

<p><img src="images/hr.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="Introductory">PRELIMINARY REMARKS.</h2>

<p class="caption">[<i>According to</i> <span class="smcap">Charles Westhall</span>, <i>a physician, as well as one of
England’s greatest pedestrians</i>.]</p>

<p><img src="images/hr.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Pedestrianism, from its being the basis and principal agent
in securing a thorough and perfect training to all who
may have, from choice or necessity, to undergo a great
amount of physical exertion, may be considered the chief
feature in the preparation of men for all contests in which
great strength, speed, and wind may be required. From
this point of view the science of walking will be treated in
the present work; for whether a man may have entered
in an engagement to run, walk, jump, swim, row, or box,
no training can be thoroughly accomplished until the
athlete has undergone a certain amount of exercise on
foot, and reduced his superfluous weight to such an
extent that he can follow up his peculiar forte with fair
chance of improvement, or at least so that he may not
have to stop short from sheer want of wind or strength.</p>

<p>Pedestrianism, which has before been stated to be more
or less indispensable to the man undergoing preparation,
from its healthful and beneficial effect upon the human
frame, is of most vital importance in keeping the required
equable balance which should exist in every constitution,
whether robust or otherwise. Good training is as requisite
to any man who wishes to excel, as it is to the thoroughbred
race-horse. A man who is fleshy and obese might
as well attempt to compete with a well-trained man as the
race-horse that has been fed for a prize-show to again
enter the lists with his highly-prepared and well-trained
contemporaries. A man may be endowed with every requisite
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
in health, strength, muscle, length, courage, bone,
and all other qualifications; but if untrained, these qualifications
are of no value, as, in every instance, a man or
horse, well-trained, of much inferior endowments, has always
under the circumstances proved the victor. Good
condition, which is the term used by trainers to indicate
the perfect state of physical power to which the athlete
has arrived, is one of the greatest safeguards to his health;
as, in many instances, severe and long-continued exertion
when unprepared has had an injurious and continuous
effect on the constitution, and, in some few but fortunately
almost isolated cases, produced almost instant death.
These few words are not alone intended for the man who
has to compete, but for a great portion of mankind, who
go through the regular routine of life day after day, their
business being sometimes performed with apathy, and the
remainder of their time passed in excessive smoking, eating,
drinking, sleeping, sitting, or any small pet vice to
which they may be addicted. That such a man can undergo
the same process of training as the professional who
has an engagement to perform some arduous task against
time or a fleet antagonist, we do not ask or expect&mdash;his
occupation would not allow the same time; but the assertion
that he would perform his allotted duties with more
pleasure to himself and more satisfaction to all concerned
if he were to submit to undergo a partial training, is a
truth that ought to be tested by all who have any regard
for continued good health. Were this system carried out
to even a small extent, the physician would have cause to
lament the decline of his practice, and the advertising
quack become a nonentity. As a proof how necessary
training is considered by the professional, it is only requisite
to ask any <i>pedestrian</i> of note for his candid opinion to
satisfy the most incredulous. The higher in the pedestrian
grade the man may be to whom the question may be put
the better, in consequence of his having gone through the
whole performance, from novicehood upwards; and, in
every instance, it will be found that more than one of his
defeats will be attributed to want of condition (proper
training) arising from neglect of work or other causes,
such as carelessness in diet, want of practice, and, in some
instances, from the neglect of the precepts attempted to be
inculcated by his trainer. Most of the above mistakes
have arisen from overweening confidence in his own powers,
or from underrating his adversaries’ abilities. However
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
willing and thoughtful he may have been, these <i>contretemps</i>
have almost invariably been the fate of all our leading
athletes, not only in the pedestrian circle, but in the ring,
on the water, and in all sports in which a great lead has
ever been taken by man. He will inform the querist that
he will require from a month to two months for his preparation,
and if he has been out of practice for some time,
even more&mdash;thus showing to the dullest intellect the requisite
time and attention needed; for if a man who has
shone pre-eminent in the sphere he has chosen for his exertions,
and has had the benefit of previous trainings, must
again undergo the same ordeal as heretofore, a man totally
untrained must at least require the same preparation, as
well as a greater amount of practice, to fully develop his
particular forte as a pedestrian. To sum up in a few words,
training is a complete system of diet and exercise duly
carried out and strenuously adhered to. From the mode
of life which almost all lead, the health becomes impaired,
and the only remedy will be discovered by him who follows
the principle of training in some form or other, the
more simple the better. That the same system of training
will suit all constitutions, it would be absurd folly to advance;
or that the same amount of work and strictness of
diet is requisite for a man about to run a race of one hundred
and twenty yards, as for a struggle of an hour’s duration,
would be equally preposterous. Nevertheless, the
groundwork of training arises from the benefits derived
from regular diet and steady exercise. Training will bring
out all the hitherto latent powers of the athlete, raising the
man who has previously been considered almost a nonentity
into public notice, the one of mediocre calibre into the first
rank, and thoroughly develop the excellencies, etc., of the
first-class proficient to an extent that will not only surprise
himself, but his associates and long-tried friends and
backers.</p>

<h2 id="Advice_to_Trainers" class="inline"><span class="smcap">Training</span> is the process of getting a man who has to perform
any muscular feat from a state of obesity and almost
total incapability into a perfect state of health, which is
shown by the great increase of strength, activity, wind,
and power to continue great exertion and pace to the
extent of his endowments. It is this acquired power
which enables the pedestrian to persevere in his arduous
task, apparently in despite of nature, which, but for his
thorough preparation, would have long before been utterly
prostrate. So much is depending on, and so many results
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
accruing to the efficiency of the trainer, that a few words
of friendly advice to that official will not be out of place;
for although the veteran has learned the precepts given
below by heart, yet there is always a beginning to all
occupations. As a rule, a great pedestrian is not qualified
at the outset of his career as a trainer to undertake the
care of most men, in consequence of there being a leaven
of the remembrance of the manner in which he went
through his work, etc., which will in most instances render
him less tolerant than is requisite to the man of mediocre
talent. Another difficulty is to find one with sufficient
education and forethought to be able to study the different
constitutions of the men under his rule. The above are
only a few of the objections; but all are of consequence, so
much depending upon the treatment of the man independent
of his daily routine of exercise and diet. The man
who goes first into training is like an unbroken colt, and
requires as much delicate treatment. The temper of the
biped ought to be studied as carefully as that of the quadruped,
so that his mind can be carefully prepared for his
arduous situation, which is one of abstinence, and in some
cases total deprivation, which always tries the patience
and frequently the temper of the competitor, who in these
cases should be encouraged by word and example, showing
that the inconveniences he is undergoing are but the preliminary
steps to the attainment of that health, strength,
and elasticity of muscle which have caused so many before
him to accomplish almost apparent impossibilities. Such a
trainer is worth a hundred of those who have no judgment
in the regulation of the work which a man may take
without in any way making him anxious to shun his duty
or to turn sullen. Let the trainer bear in mind and
always remember that a fit of ill-temper is as injurious to
the man in training as any other excess. In many instances,
from a supposed well-founded cause of complaint,
a continued civil war has arisen in the cabinet, which has
not been quelled, perhaps, until the dissension has had a
very serious effect in destroying the pedestrian’s confidence
in his trainer’s capabilities and temper, as well as throwing
back the trained man most materially in his advance
towards condition. Nevertheless, the mentor should be
firm in his manner, intelligible in his explanations, and by
no means bigoted in his favorite notions respecting the
use of any particular medicine or “nostrum” which he may
think may be requisite to the welfare of his man. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
trainer, of course, is known or supposed to be of sterling
integrity, and having the welfare of his man as his first
aim; and on this in a great measure depends the monetary
interests of the man and his backers. We are sorry to
have to mention that such a man is requisite as a trainer,
but consider it necessary to mention it, as, if the trainer is
not honest, and has not his heart in the well-doing of his
man, all the pains taken by the pedestrian would be
nullified and rendered of no avail. The trainer must be
vigilant night and day, never leave his man, and must act
according to his preaching, and be as abstemious, or nearly
so, as his man, whom it is his duty to encourage in improvement,
to cheer when despondent, and to check if
there are at any time symptoms of a break-out from the
rules laid down&mdash;but at all times he must, by anecdote,
etc., keep the mind of his man amused, so that he may not
brood over the privations he is undergoing. Let the
trainer not forget that cleanliness is one of the first rules
to be attended to, and that the bath can hardly hurt his
man in any season if only due precautions be observed,
always bearing in mind that it is a preventive instead of a
provocative to colds, catarrhs, and the long list of ills
attendant upon a sudden chill. The duration of the bath
is, of course, to be limited, and a brisk rubbing with coarse
linen cloths until the surface is in a glow will always be
found sufficient to insure perfect safety from danger. Of
course, the amount of medicine required by any man will
depend upon his constitution as well as the lowness of his
nervous system, in some cases there being no occasion to
administer even a purgative. But these are the times
when the skill of the trainer is brought into requisition,
and if he knows his business he will in these instances give
his man stimulating and generous diet, until he is enabled
to undergo the necessary privations to get him into a
proper state to be called upon to work to get into condition.
In no instance ought he to allow his man to sweat
during the days on which he has taken a purgative, as in
many instances men have been thrown back in their preparation,
or, as it is professionally termed, “trained off.”
The best test when all the superfluous flesh has been
trained off by sweating, by long walks or runs, as the case
may be, is taken from the fairness and brightness of the
skin, which is a certain criterion of good health. The
quickness with which perspiration is dried on rubbing with
towels, sufficient leanness and hardness of the muscles, is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
also the right test that reducing has been carried to the
proper extent.</h2>

<p><img src="images/hr.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="Training_for_Pedestrianism">TRAINING FOR PEDESTRIANISM.</h2>

<p>There being so many classes of individuals who may derive
benefit from training, each of whom have different
modes of living, and whose particular line of excellences
are as different from each other as light from dark, it
must be patent to all that the same system carried out to
the letter would not have the same beneficial effect on
all, the more especially in the dietary system, which, in
almost every case, would require some change, as no
two men have ever scarcely been found to thrive equally
well on a stereotyped rule. The pedestrian alone comprises
a class by itself, which is subdivided into as many
different ramifications as there are other sports and professions
that require severe training; therefore, as pedestrianism
is the groundwork of all training and all excellence
in athletic games, it is the intention to give the hints requisite
for the man who is matched to get himself sufficiently
well in bodily health and bodily power to undergo his practice
with credit to himself and trainer, and justice to his
backers. In all engagements for large amounts there is
almost invariably a trainer engaged to attend to the man
who is matched, who is supposed to thoroughly understand
his business; therefore these few words are not intended
for the guidance of those in the said position, but for those
who may wish to contend for superiority, for honor, or
small profit. The same amount of work and strict regimen
is not requisite for the sharp burst of a hundred yards or
so, that it is imperative on the trained man to undergo if
in preparation for the more arduous struggle of a mile’s
duration; but, as stated before, the theory of the practice
is the same. Westhall found that the more work he had
taken at the commencement of his training, after having
undergone the requisite medical attention, the easier and
better his fast trials were accomplished when hard work
was put on one side and daily practice took place against
a watch. Yet he, in pedestrian language, could race up
to a hundred and sixty yards, but not finish two hundred
properly&mdash;could run three hundred yards and a quarter of
a mile, but yet not be equally good at three hundred and
fifty. The same was found to be the case at the different
distances up to a mile, which is the farthest distance he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
had practiced. The first and primary aim ought to be the
endeavor to prepare the body by gentle purgative medicines,
so as to cleanse the stomach, bowels, and tissues
from all extraneous matter, which might interfere with
his ability to undergo the extra exertion it is his lot to
take before he is in a fit state to struggle through any
arduous task with a good chance of success. The number
of purgatives recommended by trainers are legion,
but the simpler will always be found the best. A couple
of anti-bilious pills at night, and salts and senna in the
morning, has answered every purpose. It is reasonable,
however, to suppose that anyone who has arrived at sufficient
years to compete in a pedestrian contest has found
out the proper remedies for his particular internal complaints.
The internal portion of the man’s frame, therefore,
being in a healthy condition, the time has arrived
when the athlete may commence his training in proper
earnest; and if he be bulky, or of obese habit, he has no
light task before him. If he has to train for a long-distance
match, the preparation will be almost similar, whether for
walking or running. The work to be done depends very
much on the time of year. In the summer the man should
rise at five in the morning, so that, after having taken his
bath, either shower or otherwise, there will have been time
for a slow walk of an hour’s duration to have been taken
before sitting down to breakfast&mdash;that is, if the weather be
favorable; but if otherwise, a bout at the dumb-bells, or
half an hour with a skipping-rope, swinging trapeze, or
vaulting-bar, will be found not unfavorable as a good
substitute. Many men can do without having any nourishment
whatever before going for the morning’s walk, but
these are exceptions to the rule. Most men who take the
hour’s walk before breaking their fast feel faint and weak
in their work after breakfast, at the commencement of their
training, and the blame is laid on the matutinal walk;
when, if a new-laid egg had been beaten in a good cup of
tea, and taken previous to going out, no symptom of faintness
would have been felt, although it is expected some
fatigue would be felt from the unwonted exertion. The
walk should be taken at such a pace that the skin does
not become moist, but have a good healthy glow on the
surface, and the man be at once ready for his breakfast at
seven o’clock. The breakfast should consist of a good
mutton chop or cutlet, from half a pound upwards, according
to appetite, with dry bread at least two days old, or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
dry toast, washed down with a cup or two of good tea
(about half a pint in all), with but little and if possible no
milk. Some give a glass of old ale with breakfast, but it
is at this time of the day too early to introduce any such
stimulant. After having rested for a sufficient time to have
allowed the process of digestion to have taken place, the
time will have arrived for the work to commence which is
to reduce the mass of fat which at this time impedes every
hurried action of the muscle and blood-vessel. This portion
of the training requires great care and thought, for
the weight of clothing and distance accomplished at speed
must be commensurate with the strength of the pedestrian.
At the commencement of the work a sharp walk of a
couple of miles out, and a smart run home, is as much as
will be advisable to risk. On the safe arrival at the training
quarters, no time must be lost in getting rid of the wet
clothes, when a thorough rubbing should be administered,
after which he should lay between blankets, and be rubbed
from time to time until the skin is thoroughly dry. Most
of the leading pedestrians of the day now, when they come
in from their run, divest themselves of their reeking flannels,
and jump under a cold shower-bath, on emerging
from which they are thoroughly rubbed down, which at
once destroys all feeling of fatigue or lassitude. In a
few days the pedestrian will be able to increase his distance
to nearly double the first few attempts at a greater
pace, and with greater ease to himself. After again dressing,
he must always be on the move, and as the feeling
of fatigue passes away he will be anxiously waiting for
the summons to dinner, which should come about one
o’clock, and which should consist of a good plain joint
of the best beef or mutton, with stale bread or toast,
accompanied by a draught of good sound old ale, the
quantity of which, however, must be regulated by the
judgment of the trainer. It has been found of late years
that extreme strictness in all cases should be put on one
side, and a small portion of fresh vegetables allowed, such
as fresh greens or potatoes; and, in some instances, good
light puddings have been found necessary to be added to
the bill of fare when the appetite, from severe work or
other causes, has been rendered more delicate than usual.</p>

<p>The continued use of meat and bread, unless the man
has a wonderful appetite and constitution, will once, if not
more, in almost every man’s training, pall upon his palate,
when the trainer should at once try the effect of poultry
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
or game, if possible; but, at any rate, not give the trained
man an opportunity of strengthening his partial dislike
to his previous fare. In cases like these, the only wrong
thing is to persevere in the previous diet; for if a man
cannot tackle his food with a healthy appetite, how is it
possible that he can take his proper share of work? The
quantity of ale should not exceed a pint, unless there has
been a greater amount of work accomplished in the morning
than usual, when a small drink of old ale at noon
would be far from wrong policy, and a good refresher to
the imbiber. Wine in small quantities is sometimes beneficial,
but should not be taken at all when malt liquors are
the standard drink. If it is possible to do without wine,
the better. The chief thing in diet is to find out what
best agrees with the man, and which in most instances will
be found to be what he has been most used to previously.</p>

<p>After a thorough rest of an hour’s duration, the pedestrian
should stroll about for an hour or two, and then,
divesting himself of his ordinary attire, don his racing gear
and shoes, and practice his distance, or, at any rate, some
portion of the same, whether he is training either for running
or walking. This portion of the day’s work must be
regulated by the judgment and advice of the trainer, who
of course is the holder of the watch by which the athlete is
timed, and is the only person capable of knowing how far
towards success the trained man has progressed in his
preparation. It is impossible for the pedestrian to judge
by his own feelings how he is performing or has performed,
in consequence of, perhaps, being stiff from his work, weak
from reducing, or jaded from want of rest. The trainer
should encourage his man when going through his trial
successfully, but stop him when making bad time, if he is
assured the tried man is using the proper exertion. The
rule of always stopping him when the pedestrian has all his
power out, and yet the watch shows the pace is not “up to
the mark,” should never be broken; for the man who so
struggles, however game he may be, or however well in
health, takes more of the steel out of himself than days of
careful nursing will restore. If stopped in time, another
trial may be attempted on the following day, or, at any
rate, the next but one. In a trial for a sprint race, which
of course must be run through to know the time, if the day
is any way near at hand, suppose a week or ten days off,
total rest should be taken the following day until the afternoon,
when another trial should take place, when a difference
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
in favor of the pedestrian will in most instances be
found to have been accomplished. In Westhall’s experience
in sprint racing there has been invariably the above
successful result. Of course, after the trial a good hand
rubbing should be administered, and the work of the day
be considered at an end. Tea-time will now have arrived,
and the meal should consist of stale bread or toast and tea,
as at breakfast, and, if the man has a good appetite, a new-laid
egg or two may be added with advantage. In the summer
a gentle walk will assist to pass away the time until
bed-time, which should be at an early hour. Before getting
into bed another good rubbing should be administered, and
the man left to his repose, which will in most cases be of
the most sound and refreshing character.</p>

<p><img src="images/hr.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="Sleep">SLEEP.</h2>

<p>Of this eight hours is an outside limit, and from six
to seven will generally be found sufficient, retiring to
rest not later than 11 <small>P. M.</small>, and rising from about 6 a. m.
to 7.30. <small>A. M.</small>, according to circumstances. The bedroom
window should always be kept open at top and bottom,
slightly in winter and wide in summer. Foul air generated
by the human breath is never more hurtful than in a bedroom.
Too much clothing should not be placed over the
chest whilst sleeping, as by so doing respiration is more
labored, and the legs and extremities, not the trunk,
require extra covering for purposes of warmth. A mattress
should be always used to sleep on, never a feather bed.
High pillows and bolsters are very injurious. The natural
height to which the head should be raised in sleep is about
the thickness of the upper portion of the arm, which constitutes
the pillow as designed by nature.</p>

<p><img src="images/hr.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="Clothing">CLOTHING.</h2>

<p>Flannel should be worn next the skin throughout the year,
but beyond this no restriction is necessary when in mufti.
The best attire for running is a pair of thin merino or silk
drawers, reaching to the knee and confined round the
waist by a broad, elastic band. For the upper part of the
body a thin merino or silk Jersey is the best. No covering
for the head is usually worn, but, in a race of such long
duration as a seven miles walking or ten miles running
contest, it is advisable to wear a cap or straw hat if the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
rays of the sun are very powerful. For running, thin
shoes made of French calf, and fitting the foot like a kid
glove when laced up, are worn. The sole should be thicker
than the heel, and contain four or five spikes, the lacing
being continued almost down to the toe. For walking
races, the heel should be thicker than the sole, and
containing a few sparrow-bill nails, none being required in
the toes. Chamois leather socks, just covering the toes,
but not reaching above the top of the shoe, are the best
adapted for running. Ordinary merino socks, but not
thick and heavy like worsted ones, and worn over the
chamois leather coverings, are the best for walking, as they
prevent the dust and grit raised from the path from getting
between the shoe and the foot. Except for sweating purposes,
heavy clothing should never be worn in practice, the
gait and stride being much impeded thereby. A piece of
cork of an elongated, egg shape should be grasped in each
hand while walking or running.</p>

<p><img src="images/hr.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="Time_and_Duration_of_Training_for_Running">TIME AND DURATION OF TRAINING FOR
RUNNING.</h2>

<p>The foregoing are the foundation rules which constitute
training, but of course they require modification according
to circumstances, which must be left to the judgment of
the pedestrian or the trainer, if he has that necessary auxiliary
to getting into good condition. For instance, the
man has had too much sweating and forced work, in consequence
of which he is getting weak, and, in the professional
term, “training off.” This will easily be recognized
by the muscles getting flaccid and sunken, with patches of
red appearing in different portions of the body, and the
man suffering from a continual and unquenchable thirst.
These well-known symptoms tell the trainer that rest must
be given to the pedestrian, as well as a relaxation from the
strict rule of diet. A couple of days’ release from hard
work will in most cases prove successful in allaying the
unwelcome symptoms, and far preferable to flying to purgatives
for relief.</p>

<p>The space of time which will be required by a young and
healthy man will be from six weeks to a couple of months;
but longer than this, if possible, would be preferable&mdash;not
that it would be really wanted to improve on the mere
physical condition of the man, but to enable the pedestrian,
when able, to go to any limit as regards exertion, and to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
have <i>time</i> for practice at his particular length; for, however
fit a man may be as regards the proper leanness, if unpractised
he would have no chance of success. The principal
rules of training, therefore, are regularity, moderate work,
and abstinence; the other adjuncts are but the necessary
embellishments to the other useful rules. When training
for running a long distance&mdash;say from four to ten miles&mdash;the
man should most decidedly practice daily; for the
shorter length going the whole distance, and for the longer
vary the distance, according to the state of health on the
day, as well as whether the weather be fine or otherwise.
For a short race of a hundred or two hundred yards, the
pedestrian, after the body is in good health, does not require
very much severe work, but the distance must be accomplished
at top speed at least once daily, and about the
same time of the day that the match will take place, if possible.
The same rules, with comparatively more work, will
apply up to 440 yards&mdash;a quarter of a mile&mdash;after which
distance more work becomes necessary.</p>

<p><img src="images/hr.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="Sprint_Running">SPRINT RUNNING.</h2>

<p>Let the novice, some five weeks or so before the day of his
race, begin his practice by a steady run, three or four times
a day, of a quarter of a mile or so; so gently at first as to
produce no stiffness of the muscles when the temperature
produced by the exercise has subsided, and the circulation
has recovered its usual condition. When the novice has
got his legs into moderate good fettle, so that they could
stand a little sharp work, he might quicken up for about 50
yards in each of his quarter spins; and as he finds these
spins can be accomplished without the slightest strain on
any muscle, the long distances may be condensed into two
a day, and two sprints of his distance at about a fifth longer
time than he would take in the race. By this means the
muscles get worked up by degrees to bear the necessary
strain required.</p>

<p>As he finds his muscles become hard and flexible, he
should lessen the length of his spins until they are of the
same length as in the race. This point will be arrived at
some nine days or so before the day, and in these nine days
all his energies must be devoted to practicing starts and getting
quickly into stride. As the day approaches, let him
obtain the services of some sprint runner to use as a trial
horse; and the best way of turning his trial horse to account
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
is by making him start slowly some 10 yards in the
rear, and, as he passes the novice, who is ready at the
scratch, let him quicken up into racing pace for about 50
yards. By this means the novice is encouraged to get off
quickly, and a surer line can be taken as to improvement in
starting than if the trial and himself started on even terms.
Again, the tendency of all young runners to watch their adversary
at the start is counteracted, the opponent in this
way being in advance, with a straight course only left open
for the novice to the goal. So many sprinters, from standing
in a wrong position at the scratch, or from taking a
longer stride with one leg than the other, jostle or run across
their opponent in the spin, thereby either losing their own
chance of success or depriving others of it. A bad beginning
makes a bad end, and nothing is so detrimental to a
sprinter as a bad start. He may get shut out, he loses his
stride, or perhaps get spiked by the man who has crossed
him; and when he does get into proper swing, he is too far
behind to be able to make up what was lost at the beginning.
Avoid walking long distances; they rather tend to
stiffen the muscles and make them slow. Never miss your
race; if you can only get one spin daily, make the most of
it. Always run in form&mdash;that is to say, as you would in the
race, on your toes, with an easy, springing action of the
thighs. In the race keep your eyes well on the tape, and
never lessen your pace when in front, or let misgivings disturb
you when behind; your opponent may have the pace
of you and not be able to stay. It is better to be a good
second than nowhere. Every race you engage in will increase
your experience and give you confidence for the next
time. Good time for 100 yards ranges from 11 seconds to
10&frac14;, according to the ground, &amp;c. The top speed is seldom
obtained until 40 yards are covered. A good sprinter will
generally beat two others in 200 yards, each to run 100
yards with him on end. For sprinting, wind is not such a
desideratum as elasticity of muscle. The shorter the distance,
the greater care and practice should be made in starting;
the longer you have to sprint, the greater will be the
necessity for working up the muscles. In practice, run
with as slight clothing on as possible; <i>buff</i> is to be
preferred. The action of the air on the skin keeps
up a healthy flow of blood to the surface, and will do
more towards a beneficial reduction of weight than any
amount of sweatings, baths, or other appliances of the
old school.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span></p>

<p><img src="images/hr.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="Quarter_and_Half_Mile_Running">QUARTER AND HALF MILE RUNNING.</h2>

<p>A quarter of a mile is, perhaps, next to the 300 yards, the
most patronized of any. Assuming our trainee to be in robust
health, the muscles should be gradually accustomed to
the exercise by slow spins of half a mile each, two or three
times a day, taking about from 3min. to 2min. 25sec., according
to the individual, to do it. When the distance is
accomplished with comparative ease, practice style and pace
for about 300 yards to 350 yards to within about a week of
the race, when the whole distance may be run, two or three
times at top speed for 400 yards, slower the last 40. Ease
up the practice in the last three days, merely working up
pace for 100 yards or so. The same method of training will
suit the half mile runner, with the exception of his spins being
longer, and more attention paid to an equal pace of going.
The quarter requires more speed than the half mile;
consequently that point must be attended to. A steady,
machine-like style of going pays best for the half mile
runner.</p>

<p><img src="images/hr.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="One_Mile_Running_and_upwards">ONE MILE RUNNING AND UPWARDS.</h2>

<p>In practicing for a mile race and upwards, a long, steady
course of slow running must be gone through to get the
limbs and the wind gradually accustomed to the work. As
they improve, quicken your pace, and for mile running
practice half a mile or so in about 2min. 20sec., until the
wind becomes good; then lengthen the daily spins to three-quarters
of a mile fast, and the last quarter slowly. Never
do much work the last few days, but have a few fast spins
of 300 yards or so, to keep the muscles in form. In longer
distance training, the same steady practice must be followed,
with this exception, that, instead of practicing pace,
rather get the condition of wind and muscle up as high as
practicable, and reserve your energies for the day of the
race.</p>

<p><img src="images/hr.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="Hurdle_Racing">HURDLE RACING.</h2>

<p>The usual hurdle race distance is 120 yards, with 10
flights of hurdles 3ft. 6in. high and 10 yards apart. This
gives a run of 15 yards at both ends. The quickest way of
getting over them is by taking them in stride, or technically
bucking them. If the ground is firm and level, this can be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
done, and three strides will take the jumper from hurdle to
hurdle, the fourth taking him over. Should the ground be
uneven, slippery or heavy, great care is required in bucking
them. Touching the top bar will inevitably be followed by
a fall or a stumble sufficient to put the jumper out of the
race. In bucking, the spring is taken from one leg, and
the alight comes on the other; so that the jump, instead of
being an actual interruption of the regular strides, as happens
when the spring and the alight come on the same leg,
is merely an exaggerated stride. The advantage of bucking
is apparent to anyone who has tried both systems under
favorable circumstances, and who is strong enough to
bear the strain which the high hurdles require. The lower
the hurdles are, the greater is the superiority of bucking
over jumping. To acquire the art of taking the hurdles in
stride, practice over jumps about 2ft. 6in. high, at the proper
distance apart, until the style is learnt.</p>

<h2 id="Hints_In_Before_and_After_the_Race">HINTS IN, BEFORE, AND AFTER THE RACE.</h2>

<p>In sprinting, a good start is of such importance that we
would suggest a careful practice in it. It is a curious fact
that a novice will invariably start with one foot a yard or
so behind the other, either with the body bent down low,
or with the body erect, and swinging the arms as if they
were the means of propulsion about to be trusted to. In
the former case, he runs one yard more than his distance,
in the latter he exhausts and unsteadies himself. Start
with both feet within six inches of one another, the weight
of the body resting on that foot which is farthest from the
scratch, and the toe on the side nearest the goal, just
touching the ground, and ready to take the first step over
the mark; the body must be kept well up, so that the
first spring is taken steadily and in a straight line. As
this method is the quickest for getting off the mark, it will
apply to every description of pedestrianism.</p>

<p>Before any contest, when you are stripped, take a trot to
get the limbs into order and keep them warm; the muscles
will be less likely to get strained if well heated beforehand.
In running with a chicken-hearted man, race at him, and, if
you feel done, fancy that he feels worse. Run as straight
to the goal as possible; it is the nearest way home, and
therefore the quickest. The arms should be kept well up,
and moved in the direction of the course, and not swung
across the body. Any scrambling in the race is fatal to a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
good walker; the motion of his legs should be mechanical.
In walking races, if a stitch bothers you, keep well on,
and try and forget it; it will never last long if you are in
good condition. In a race with heats, after a heat lie down
on your back, and keep the legs raised up, in order that the
blood forced into the extremities by the exercise may be assisted
by its own gravity to return to the trunk. Rest is
the best cure for a strain, and is much assisted by cold water
application. In a strain of the internal organs, their
complexity renders repair a more difficult operation, as
they do not allow of repose; recourse should therefore be
had to a physician.</p>

<p>Running on the toes on a path is to be recommended, as
enabling a longer stride to be taken, and giving an easier
motion to the body, and less jar at each step. In heavy
ground, however, it is of little use, as the sinking of the toe
in the soil interferes with the spring, and necessitates a
larger surface of the foot to get a purchase for the next
stride.</p>

<p>Never in practice run with many clothes on; if the
weather is cold, clothe in proportion. The action of the
air on the skin increases its healthy vigor. A piece of cork
is often held in each hand to grasp while running. In a
long distance race, rinsing the mouth out with warm tea
with a little brandy in it, and munching a crust, will often
take away any dryness of throat. Never commence fast
sprinting in practice unless the muscles are thoroughly
warm. Strains would seldom happen if this was attended
to. Fruit fresh picked is not to be discarded. A small
quantity, when ripe, will often give tone to the stomach
and cool the blood. Of dried fruits, figs are supposed to
be the most serviceable.</p>

<p><img src="images/hr.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="Training_Practice_Fair_Walking_etc">TRAINING PRACTICE, FAIR WALKING, ETC.</h2>

<p>Walking is the most useful and at the same time most
abused branch of athletic sports; not so much from the
fault of the pedestrians as from the inability or want of
courage of the judge or referee to stop the man who, in his
eagerness for fame or determination to gain money anyhow,
may trespass upon fair walking, and run. Walking
is a succession of steps, not leaps, and with one foot always
on the ground. The term “fair toe and heel” was meant
to infer that, as the foot of the back leg left the ground,
and before the toes had been lifted, the heel of the foremost-foot
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
should be on the ground. Even this apparently
simple rule is broken almost daily, in consequence of the
pedestrian performing with a bent and loose knee, in
which case the swing of his whole frame when going at
any pace will invariably bring both feet off the ground at
the same time; and although he is going heel and toe, he
is not taking the required succession of steps, but is infringing
the great and principal one, of one foot being
continually on the ground. The same fault will be brought
on by the pedestrian leaning forward with his body, and
thereby leaning his weight on the front foot, which, when
any great pace is intended, or the performer begins to be
fatigued, first merges into a very short stride, and then into
a most undignified trot. There is no finer sight among the
long catalogue of athletic sports, more exhilarating and
amusing to the true sportsman, than to see a walking-match
carried out to the strict letter of the meaning, each
moving with the grandest action of which the human frame
is capable, at a pace which the feeble frame and mind is
totally unable to comprehend, and must be witnessed to be
believed. To be a good and fair walker, according to the
recognized rule among the modern school, the attitude
should be upright, or nearly so, with the shoulders well
back, and the arms, when in motion, held well up in a bent
position, and at every stride swing with the movement of
the legs, well across the chest, which should be well thrown
out. The loins should be slack, to give plenty of freedom
to the hips, and the leg perfectly straight, thrown out from
the hip boldly, directly in front of the body, and allowed
to reach the ground with the heel being decidedly the first
portion of the foot to meet it. The movement of the
arms, as above directed, will keep the balance of the body,
and bring the other leg from the ground, when, the same
conduct being pursued, the tyro will have accomplished
the principal and most difficult portion of his rudiments.
This will in a very short time become natural to him, and
the difficulty will be the infringement of the correct manner.
The novice having learned how to walk, and being
matched, requires training, which must be under the same
rules as have been laid down previously, with the difference,
however, that his sweats must be taken at his best walking-pace,
the trot by all means being totally barred. A continued
perseverance in the practice of this rule will enable
the pedestrian to persevere, notwithstanding all the shin-aches,
stitches, and other pains attendant on the proper
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
training for a walking-match, and which every man must
undergo before he can be considered worthy of being
looked upon as a fast and fair walker. The tyro must not
be discouraged with his first feeble and uncertain attempts
if they should not come up to his crude anticipations, but
bear in mind that, although the accomplished pedestrian
goes through his apportioned task with great apparent
ease, he has gone through the rudiments, and that nothing
but great practice has enabled him to perform the apparent
impossibilities which are successfully overcome almost
daily. Therefore the young walker must take for his motto
“Perseverance,” and act up to the same by continued
practice. The man training for a match should walk some
portion of his distance, if weather permits, daily, in his
walking-dress, which should consist of a light elastic shirt,
short drawers, and light Oxford ties. On starting, he
must go off at his <i>very</i> best pace, and continue it for at
least three hundred yards or a quarter of a mile, by which
time he will have begun to blow very freely, and then,
getting into a good, long, regular stride, his principal aim
must be to keep his legs well in advance of his body.</p>

<p>The rule of getting away fast in trials should be invariably
carried out; it prepares the man for a sharp tussle
with his opponent for the lead, and will hinder him being
taken off his legs in the match. When tired he can also
ease his exertions; but if he is in the habit of going off
at a steady gait, in the generality of instances he is virtually
defeated in a match before he has commenced racing.
Moreover, he must, when undergoing distress from the
pace he has been doing, never by any chance cease his
resolute and ding-dong action; for distress, if once given
way to by easing, will of course leave the sufferer, but at
the same time all speed has also departed, and not for a
short space of time either, but sufficiently long for the
gamer man, who would not succumb to the inevitable result
of continued severe exertion, to obtain such an advantage
as would be irrecoverable, as well as to conquer
the aches and pains which invariably leave the well-trained
pedestrian when the circulation and respiration become
equalized&mdash;“second wind” it is better known by. After
this happy and enviable stage of affairs has been reached
the work becomes mechanical, and the pedestrian
from time to time is enabled to put on spurts and dashed
that would astonish himself at any other time when
not up to thorough concert pitch. The recovery from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
these electrifying dashes is almost instantaneous, and
the pedestrian keeps on his satisfactory career until sheer
fatigue gradually diminishes his speed, although none of
the previous aches and pains are present. The trainer
must not forget the previously-mentioned rule of stopping
the man when good time is not the result of his best
and hardest exertions, as that bad time proves unerringly
that something must be amiss which requires looking to
thoroughly. As well might the engineer of a locomotive,
on finding out that some of the internal works of his engine
were out of gear, put on all his steam, and then wonder at
the machinery being out of order at a future time of trial.</p>

<p>One word more. Let the man continually bear in mind
that “it is the pace that kills,” and that slow walking never
made a fast race or fast man; let him practice at his best
pace, which will daily improve. The commencement of
fast work will most likely bring on pain of the shins, which
will be sore after the exertion has been discontinued, as
well as other portions of the frame being in the same predicament.
Hand-rubbing with a stimulating embrocation
(of which the recipe is appended) before a good fire will
in most instances be all that is required; but if obstinate,
a hot bath will insure the removal of all the obstinate
twitches, etc. The shoes for match-walking should be of
the lightest description commensurate with strength for
the distance required. They should be of sufficient width
and length to give the muscles and tendons of the foot
full play, without being in the slightest degree cramped.
They should be laced up the front, and care taken that the
lace is sound and new. So much importance is attached
to this, that stout wax-ends are now invariably in use.
Some advocate the use of boots; but, although stated to
be useful if there is any weakness of the ankle&mdash;a pedestrian
with weak ankles!&mdash;is there no cold water?&mdash;the heat
generated by them would certainly counterbalance the supposed
benefit; and there is the difference in the weight,
which would tell at the finish of a long match.</p>

<p><img src="images/hr.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="High_Jumping">HIGH JUMPING.</h2>

<p>Begin by gentle runs of about three hundred yards, with
a few low jumps, say ten, about three feet high. Practice
over these jumps for a few days until the stiffness of the
muscles wears off, and then gradually raise them to four
feet or four feet six inches. If this height cannot be cleared
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
easily, place the jumps at the most suitable height. Care
must be taken to do them quickly and neatly. The run between
may be slow, but the jumps should always be taken
with a quick spring, landing on both feet every time. If
this <i>modus operandi</i> is paid attention to, the muscles will
soon become accustomed to the sharp contraction required,
and the legs will, by keeping them well together over low
jumps and alighting on both feet, lose their tendency to
straddle when a higher jump than usual is attempted.</p>

<p>Some, when in practice for high jumps, strengthen their
muscles by standing on one leg and lowering the body down
until the hams touch the heels, and then raising themselves
up gradually again. This action, however much it may
be beneficial to the sinews, cannot but give them a tendency
to be slow, which should be avoided as much as possible.
A heavy coat, with a weight in both pockets, is of some
service to those athletes stripped and ready to compete, as
a great sense of lightness and elasticity is imparted to the
frame on its removal. The heavy coat should never be
worn except in the few minutes preceding the trial, as by
constant use the good effects wear off. Always have a soft
place to alight upon, as it not only eases the jar of the jump,
but gives a jumper more confidence when he feels secure
from the chances of a twist of the ankles on touching the
ground. Hard turf, with very fine ashes rolled in until the
surface is quite level, makes the best fair taking-off place
both for high and broad jumping.</p>

<p><img src="images/hr.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="Broad_Jumping">BROAD JUMPING.</h2>

<p>Begin with a few jumps about twelve feet or so, taking your
run for them slowly, starting about twenty yards off and
quickening in the last few strides. The great object to be
guarded against is taking off to far from the mark, or getting
out of step in the run; this can only be obviated by
practicing at a certain distance until the necessary swing of
the last few strides is acquired. The run to the jump cannot
be too fast; in the air the legs should be raised as in
going over a high jump, and thrown as far forward on landing
as can be done with both heels close together. No fear
need be entertained of falling back on alighting if the run
is sufficiently fast and the landing place level and soft; the
impetus derived from the run gives the heaviest part of the
jumper, the trunk, sufficient momentum to carry itself forward
when the progress of the feet and legs is arrested.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
The landing place should be soft to the depth of eight
inches, and sufficiently binding to show the marks of the
heels clearly on alighting; clay and mould mixed make the
best landing ground. A soft place to jump on will prevent
any jar to the knees, and will give the jumper more confidence.
The concussion caused by landing on hard ground
may sometimes cause a serious accident.</p>

<h2 id="Hammer_Throwing">HAMMER THROWING.</h2>

<p>The muscles of the loins and back are the ones principally
brought into play in hammer throwing, and by their development
they become extremely serviceable in assisting
the spine to bear the upper portions of the body. The
practice of this kind of exercise must, therefore, be beneficial
to those whose lungs and heart are too delicate to
stand any of those sports, such as rowing, running, etc.,
which so particularly tax their working powers. Commence
practicing with a hammer about 7lb., until the art of
swinging while running is acquired; to learn this the run
should be taken at first only six or seven yards from the
scratch; before the run swing the hammer well, like a pendulum,
in the direction of the mark two or three times,
until it has acquired a good momentum, and then start,
taking, at the first few attempts, one turn only in the run;
afterwards, as the practice becomes easier, two turns can
be made, and the runs lengthened in proportion. Some
athletes, however, take three or four turns, but, as a rule,
two will be found sufficient. Between the turns, run as far
towards the scratch as possible, taking long, even strides to
acquire a good impetus, and keeping up the centrifugal
force of the hammer by swinging it well round low, and in
a plane at right angles to the body. The arms should be
kept quite straight the whole time, merely acting as if they
were a prolongation of the handle. The work is done by the
muscles of the back and loins, and in delivering the hammer
at the scratch the athlete should, above all things,
bear in mind that he does not lift it as if lifting to leg.
The “devil” must be put into the swing as the hammer descends
in the last half of the turn, so that the force has
culminated by the time the hammer is crossing the line
parallel to the scratch, where it must be let go, the body at
the same moment being thrown back to counteract the impetus
of the swing. The hammer should describe a curve
at its highest point of not more than 11 or 12 feet from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
ground. Avoid pulling at the handle in the run, and increase
the pace and swing at each successive turn. The
farthest throw of the 11lb. hammer, 3 feet handle, on record,
is 176 feet. The 22lb. hammer has been thrown over
94 feet.</p>

<p><img src="images/hr.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="Putting_the_Stone">PUTTING THE STONE.</h2>

<p>Balance the body on the right leg, the left side turned
towards the scratch, the right foot being placed as near the
seven-foot mark as possible, and the right hand balancing
the weight, with the knuckles close to the shoulder; raise
the weight up to the full stretch of the arm two or three
times, till the muscles get into play, still keeping the weight
of the body thrown on to the right leg, the left foot touching
the ground slightly; when the balance of the body is
obtained, hop three feet towards the mark, and then spring
up sharply to the scratch line, throwing the weight away at
the same moment, and bringing the right leg down, with
the toe touching the scratch line and the right side of the
body to the mark. By this means the follow of the body
after the weight is prevented, and, by bringing the right leg
forward at the moment of throwing, the whole force of the
thighs are brought into play, and the muscles of the loins
assist in the sudden turn of the body from left to right.
The weight must be held on the lowest joints of the fingers
and the palm of the hand, the wrist being kept as stiff as
possible, and all tendency to throw it as a ball avoided. A
heave is not so effective as a quick jump, with the muscles
concentrated at the same moment. The quicker the hop
and the throw are made, the further the distance put, provided
that the balance is not lost. Any delay between the
first hop and the final spring is fatal. In delivering the
weight, let it be put upwards&mdash;that is to say, aim to hit an
object about fourteen feet above the spot where the weight
will pitch. The further the weight has to be put, the higher
must be the elevation. No exercise is a greater proof of
strength than this. Very little skill is required; and when
once the way of putting is learnt, it seldom happens that a
strong man gets beaten by the knack of a weaker antagonist.</p>

<p>The ankle is the part most likely to suffer, from the fact
of having to spring with the whole of the body, and the addition
of the weight. To practice, a cricket ball may be
used instead of a heavy weight, and the spring made as before,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
with the delivery of the ball. After a little practice, a
heavier weight may be tried until the one required can be
put properly. The best “puts” on record are for the 22lb.
weight over 36 feet, and for the 16lb. over 41 feet.</p>

<p><img src="images/hr.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="Training_for_Rowing_etc">TRAINING FOR ROWING, ETC.</h2>

<p>The present work is not intended for the guidance of professional
oarsmen, or those who may row for large stakes,
and who, when matched, leave their usual occupations and
devote their energies to the better observance of the
stricter rules of training. Such men invariably have a
mentor worthy of following, and whose knowledge of right
and wrong will lead them to success or otherwise, as the
fates may dispose. The amateur, however, must be treated
more gently and with more attention than the sturdier and
hardier professional, or those who may have made the river
and adjuncts their capital in their struggle through the
world for a subsistence. The amateur, when he has an engagement
before him, should take into consideration the
time he has allowed him to train, and the mode of proceeding
will depend in a great measure on the condition
and previous habits of the man engaged. If a man is
fleshy and of a full habit of body, a dose or two of mild
purgative medicine should be taken, and slow walking exercise
only taken on the day the doses have been administered.
After the medicine has done its duty, if the amateur
is very fleshy, a Turkish bath or two may be taken with advantage,
the usual precautions against cold being used.
The subject, after one or two of these sweats, is prepared
for more arduous work, which may be taken at a fair pace
in the form of good sharp runs and fast walks, which, like
all other trainings, will become easier of accomplishment
at each repetition.</p>

<p>The above work, with rowing exercise, will infallibly
bring the practitioner, if continued for any time, into a
proper condition to contend with confidence and success
in any rowing contest.</p>

<p>He must rise at five in the summer, and after his bath
(cold), and having been well rubbed down, a good sharp
walk of about a mile out and a rattling spin taken by running
home, when another good rub will be rendered imperative
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
Should the run not be taken, a row of a couple of
miles at three parts speed must be accomplished. When
thoroughly cooled down, breakfast should be taken, which
should consist of good wholesome meat (either broiled
mutton-chops or steak, with no seasoning), stale bread
or toast, and tea. When dinner can be taken at mid-day,
say about one P. M., it is better, and should consist, like
the breakfast, of good wholesome roast meat, with no vegetable
except a mealy potato, stale bread, and not more than
a pint of really good sound ale (old, if palatable to the
drinker, the best); some prefer sherry, but, although agreeing
with a few, the ale, as a rule, is more strengthening and
wholesome. The row should be taken before tea, which
should then be of the same viands and liquids as the breakfast.
The above rules, of course, are open to alteration, according
to circumstances, and the diet varied successfully
by the introduction of fowls, either roast or boiled&mdash;the
latter preferred&mdash;and when there is any indication of training
off, a small portion of green-meat, in the shape of sound
cabbage or any fresh vegetable in season. The last food
before retiring to rest should be either about half a-pint of
thin gruel or a glass of ale with dry toast. The other portion
of the day’s training must be left to circumstances;
but it must never be lost sight of that sharp work, regularity
and cleanliness are the chief if not the only rules to be
followed to produce thorough good condition. The use of
the bath should never by any chance be missed. Nothing
is more injurious to the wind, etc., than hard rowing on a
full stomach, the ill effects of which, although scarcely felt
at the time, have at a more remote time, in many instances,
proved to be the germ of serious disorders.</p>

<p>In rowing, the legs, loins, trunk, arms, hands, the digestive
organs and the lungs are made to perform their
regular and legitimate functions simultaneously, and the
danger of building up one part of the system at the expense
of another thereby avoided, and to the recognition
of these facts is ascribed the popularity of aquatic sports
here and abroad. But it is not always convenient for large
numbers of our people to indulge in this healthful pastime;
the expense of owning and keeping a boat, the difficulty of
reaching an acceptable place for rowing, no less than the
dangers incident to inexperienced oarsmen upon the
water, are drawbacks which can only be met by the substitution
of a machine giving all the advantages without
the disagreeable accessories; to this end several machines
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
have been introduced to public notice, but none have filled
all the requirements until by careful observation of the defects
of former attempts the Eureka Parlor Rowing Machine
was introduced, which gives an exact and perfect
imitation of rowing. It teaches to feather the oar correctly,
it gives the dip of the oar, it has the sliding seat,
it can be regulated for heavy or light, short or long stroke,
and is manufactured for either open or cross-handed rowing,
and the pressure can be changed to suit the weak or
the strong.</p>

<h3>MORE INFORMATION ABOUT TRAINING FOR
ROWING.</h3>

<p>For the further information of those who cannot have
too much of a good thing as to the preparation for rowing
a race, we subjoin the latest ideas of modern authorities
upon the subject.</p>

<h3>JOSH WARD’S SYSTEM OF TRAINING.</h3>

<p>The following rules, from the pen of Josh Ward, ex-champion
sculler and captain of the Ward crew, which
among their other achievements won the International
four-oared race at Saratoga in 1871, will be first-class authority:</p>

<p>First, be sure that the men are in perfect health, so that
they will be able to stand the work which they are about
to commence.</p>

<p>A mild medicine is usually required to cleanse the blood,
as, unless the blood is in good order, and in very many
cases it is in any other condition than a good one, the food
taken will not digest well.</p>

<p>Upon getting up in the morning take a sponge bath,
dry well with a coarse towel, after which walk about two
miles before breakfast.</p>

<p>Breakfast should consist of a good tender porterhouse
steak, broiled rare, and thoroughly masticated before
swallowing. As a drink, a cup of black tea. Drink no more
than absolutely necessary either at meals or any other time.</p>

<p>After breakfast, eaten slowly, no exercise should be taken
for about an hour; at the expiration of which time, the
crew can get in the boat and row the same distance expected
to be rowed in the race, and at a good pace.</p>

<p>After returning from the row, a rub down and then a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
moderate walk, until shortly before dinnertime. Dinner
should consist of roast beef or broiled chicken, with soft
boiled eggs, etc.</p>

<p>If any drink is taken, tea or water, in moderate quantity,
should be used. After dinner no exercise for about
two hours, when the crew take the afternoon pull, which
should be over about the same distance and at the same
pace as that of the morning.</p>

<p>After coming ashore, rub down as in the morning, with
a coarse towel, and then take a moderate walk, returning
home about an hour before supper, which, when eaten at
all, should be a light one, composed of a little broiled meat,
with a piece of dry toast and a cup of tea.</p>

<p>Two meals, at the least, should always be taken; and
where only two are taken, they should, in all cases, be
what is known as breakfast and dinner, as both these
meals, or rather either of them, are more essential to the
man in training than supper, particularly if he, as I
would advise him to do, rises with the sun and retires at
about nine o’clock, or half-past, in the evening.</p>

<p>After a night’s sleep, and after having left the bed at
five in the morning and walked or ran two, three or four
miles, as well as taking a bath, the system is generally
quite importunate for sustenance by seven o’clock or half-past.</p>

<p>This is not always the case, however, in regard to supper;
as, after having eaten a hearty dinner, at 1 o’clock,
without any other exercise thereafter than the afternoon
row, a man with very little practice can accustom himself
to doing without more food until the following morning,
if he retire at about nine o’clock.</p>

<p>Up with the sun in the morning and pursue the regular
plan of bath, walk, etc., unless stormy, in which case exercise
indoors should be substituted for the walk.</p>

<p>The dumbells and clubs are proper implements to use
for this purpose, and every man in training, whether amateur
or professional, should have one or other, or both.</p>

<p>The man in training should always have plenty of exercise
given him at regular and proper intervals. By
plenty of exercise I mean just enough, neither too much
nor too little; and to be able to tell just when a man has
just enough belongs only to those who have had an extensive
experience in preparing men for aquatic or other
contests.</p>

<p>His habits must, of necessity, be very regular, otherwise
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
the course which he is pursuing will result in very little
good.</p>

<p class="caption">MADAME ANDERSON,
the great 2,700 Quarter-mile Walker.</p></div>

<p>In regard to the oars which myself and brothers&mdash;the
Ward crew&mdash;generally use, they are sweeps, about twelve
feet long and five inches wide. A boat for our crew of
four would be forty-six feet long and twenty inches wide.
In pulling we use the legs, and in a four or six-oared boat
pull forty and forty-two strokes per minute. In pulling a
pair of sculls, I pull about thirty-eight strokes to the minute,
and use the legs.</p>

<p>We used spoon oars, and our boats were constructed
with the stroke on the starboard side.</p>

<p>In sculling, I have always pulled open-handed, but I
think cross-handed is the better style.</p>

<p>To make a successful rower great practice will be required,
although in this, as in everything else, some learn
much more rapidly than others.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Benjamin F. Brady, ex-president of the Amateur Rowing
Association, furnishes the subjoined:</p>

<p>Coxswains are carried in the gigs and barges only; all
the shells being constructed to dispense with them, and it
is safe to predict that they will soon come to be a thing of
the past in all American shell races. Whether with or
without a coxswain is the more practical or scientific, depends,
in a great measure, upon the nature of the course
pulled, and the efficiency of the bow oar; but an experienced
crew can well get along without one. While the
fact has been several times proven that a good coxswain
has been the means of winning a race with an acknowledged
inferior crew.</p>

<h3>COXSWAIN’S ORDERS</h3>

<p>Among the Clubs of the Association, are given as follows:</p>

<p>1st. “Oars.”&mdash;The crew raising their oars to an angle of
forty-five degrees and then placing them in the thole pins.</p>

<p>2d. “Out.”&mdash;The crew running their oars out to the
proper distance for rowing, the blade being parallel with
the gunwale of the boat.</p>

<p>3d. “Give-way.”&mdash;At the word “Give” throwing the
handle of the oar forward well over the toes, the blade
being at a proper angle to strike the water; and at the
word “Way” dipping the oar in the commencement of
the pull.</p>

<p>4th. “Weigh.”&mdash;To stop rowing.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span></p>

<p>5th. “Weigh-starboard,” or “Weigh-port.” To turn right or left.</p>

<p>6th. “Easy-all.”&mdash;To slacken speed.</p>

<p>7th. “Oars-apeak.”&mdash;To salute when at rest. The oars
to be raised perpendicularly, the handles resting on the
floor, and the blades running fore and aft.</p>

<p>8th. “Weigh-across,” “Apeak.” To salute when under headway.
Running the oars across both gunwales.</p>

<p>9th. “Let-fall.”&mdash;To regain former position. At the
word “Let,” raising the oar about four inches, and at the
word “Fall,” throwing it into the thole-pins, the blade
“first” touching the water.</p>

<p>10th. “Across-ship.”&mdash;To get the oars in the boat. At
the word “Ship,” raising the oar at a distance to clear
the heads of the crew, and dropping it lightly in the centre
of the boat.</p>

<p>11th. “Trail-oars.”&mdash;In passing through bridges, culverts,
etc., unshipping the oar and trailing it at the side of
the boat.</p>

<p>12th. “Recover-oars.”&mdash;To regain former position.</p>

<p>The number of strokes pulled by the association crews it
would be impossible to designate, with any degree of accuracy,
as all rowers have their own peculiar styles; and in
many cases a man, or a crew, may start at the rate of
thirty-six to the minute and increase to forty, and finish
at, or near, thirty-two. In practicing a crew, a “pull,”
and “tire out,” is certainly detrimental to proper training,
as a crew should “never” be over-worked.</p>

<p>The mode of dipping the oar among the association
crews is, as a general rule, to immerse about one-half the
blade; row with the back straight, elbows well at the sides.</p>

<h3>STEPHEN ROBERTS’ SYSTEM.</h3>

<p>In training a crew for a race, the habits and mode of
living of a man are to be consulted more than any set of
rules. If he is used to eating meat well cooked, it will not
do to give him meat cooked rare, as this is apt to produce
a looseness in his bowels. A man must eat according to
the state of his system, and if he trains hard, eats meat,
and is troubled with loose bowels, he should train light
and live on toast, bread, and coffee or tea, for a few days,
with puddings, or bread and milk; and if he is used to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
drinking, good fresh ale will not hurt him, but no liquor
stronger than porter or ale should be used. On the other
hand, if costiveness is present, no longer than forty-eight
hours should be permitted to elapse without a motion, and
this should be brought about, if possible, by making use
of the suitable food and drink; such, for instance, as the
veal steaks cooked rare, with cider or water as a drink.</p>

<p>The main thing, in training a man or crew, is to give
him or them plenty of the same kind of work performed in
the race. Be careful, however, not to put on too much at
first. If a mile race is to be pulled, twenty days’ training
will be required.</p>

<p>The first day, row, say one mile; the second and third
day, about the same, or a little more, not too hard. After
this, increase the distance half a mile every day, until five
miles are gone over at each row. Then, if there are no
blisters on the hands, row the whole distance at racing
pace. Every other day, row eight or ten miles, up to
within twenty-four hours of the race. Less rowing than
this should not be taken; more will not hurt.</p>

<p>Clerks, bookkeepers, etc., generally require two weeks
more of training than men who have been always used to
heavy lifting; but, when a man once does get into good
training, his race becomes an easy matter for him.</p>

<h3>THE HARVARD SYSTEM.</h3>

<p>Broiled steak or chops, potatoes in almost any style,
without grease, bread nearly fresh, tea if desired, water, or
milk if preferred, oatmeal porridge or gruel, and eggs
poached or boiled&mdash;not very hard&mdash;render the breakfast
of a Harvard student in training palatable and even attractive.</p>

<p>The best roast beef or mutton procurable, potatoes,
bread, cracked wheat, rice, oatmeal gruel, and the various
vegetables in the market, often, if not regularly, make the
dinner inviting; and a piece of salmon or a dish of poultry
or game is an occasional visitor, aiding to vary yet more
the programme. Tapioco, farina and other vegetable puddings
make an admirable substitute for heavy puddings as
a desert. Milk, water, and tea again, and also butter and
salt, in reasonable quantities, are permitted.</p>

<p>Bread and milk, or tea, butter, oatmeal gruel, dry toast
and crackers, are the chief and often only articles taken at
supper.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span></p>

<p>About a half hour’s careful rowing at a tolerable pace,
with an occasional stop or “easy,” for instruction and
rest, in the morning.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, an hour’s rowing, with not more than
two or three rests, will complete the day’s water work.</p>

<p>The rate of speed in the afternoon should go up from
thirty-five strokes a minute when commencing training to
racing gait during the last two weeks, and pulling over the
proposed course once “on time” will be plenty of work
for this last period.</p>

<p>A three or four mile walk, at a four-mile gait, starting
an hour after breakfast, will not, unless in extremely hot
weather, prove too much for a vigorous young man with
ordinarily good legs. The speed of this walk should be
reached gradually, and after, perhaps, if a man in the start
is much out of condition, say two weeks slower going.</p>

<p>A thorough rubbing of the entire body, until the skin is
absolutely red, should “immediately” follow each row,
and then a dry suit should be donned. Flannel is the best
material for it.</p>

<p>Eight hours should seem a good medium for sleep. If
a man feels all right with a less amount than this, he
should regulate his own hours; but if he is nervous and
excitable, he should have more. He should never lie abed
awake in the morning, but spring up at once, and take his
sponge bath, or in warm weather, if convenient, a plunge
into cold water.</p>

<h3>HARRY CLASPER’S SYSTEM.</h3>

<p>Rise between 6 and 7 <small>A. M.</small>, walk four or five miles.
Breakfast at 8 <small>A. M.</small>&mdash;Chop or couple of eggs, bread, tea,
Rest for half an hour, and then a brisk walk or run. If
morning exercise has not been heavy, a row, terminating
about 11 <small>A. M.</small> Dinner at 12 <small>M.</small>&mdash;Beef or mutton, broiled;
egg-pudding, with currants in it if desired, or other light
farinaceous pudding; old ale, one glass; wine, one glass,
(port); or ale, two glasses, without wine. Rest for an hour,
and then on the river again for a hard row. “Rowing exercise
should be taken twice every day.” Tea, with toasted
bread sparingly buttered, with one egg only&mdash;more has a
tendency to choke the system. Supper, not recommended.
When taken, to consist of new milk and bread, or gruel,
with raisins and currants and a glass of port wine in it.
Bed about 10 <small>P. M.</small> <i>Summary</i>: sleep, between eight and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
nine hours; exercise, walking and rowing about four or
five hours; diet, limited.</p>

<h3>CHARLES WESTHALL’S SYSTEM.</h3>

<p>Rise at 6 <small>A. M.</small> or earlier in the summer; cold bath and
rub down; sharp walk about a mile out, and run home; or a
row of a couple of miles at three-parts speed; a dry rub
down. Breakfast at 8 <small>A.M.</small>&mdash;Mutton chop or steak, broiled;
stale bread or toast, tea, half a pint. Dinner at 2 <small>P. M.</small>&mdash;Meat
as at breakfast with a mealy potato, stale bread, old
ale, one pint. Rowing. If dinner be late, luncheon to be
taken, to consist of beef or mutton, hot or cold; bread, old
ale, one glass. If dinner be early, “tea with viands and
liquids as at breakfast” to be taken. Supper&mdash;Half a pint
of thin gruel, or dry toast and a glass of old ale. That the
above rules are of course open to alteration according to
circumstances, and the diet varied successfully by the introduction
of fowls, either roast or boiled&mdash;the latter preferred;
and it must never be lost sight of that sharp work,
regularity and cleanliness are the chief if not the only
rules to be followed to produce thorough good condition.
<i>Summary</i>: sleep, about eight hours; exercise, four or five
hours; diet, limited.</p>

<h3>H. F. WALSH’S, OR STONEHENGE’S SYSTEM.</h3>

<p>Rise at 8 <small>A. M.</small> According to season and weather, cold
bath. Exercise, 8.30 to 9 <small>A. M.</small>&mdash;Let all take a gentle run
or smart walk. In most instances a smart run of three
miles will be about the best distance.</p>

<p>Breakfast; 9 to 9.30 <small>A. M.</small>&mdash;Oatmeal porridge, with beef
or mutton broiled, and bread; tea or coffee, or old ale, one
pint. Tea is preferred to coffee. Cocoa is too greasy.</p>

<p>Exercise, 9.30 to 11.30 <small>A. M.</small>&mdash;Billiards, skittles, quoits, or
other light exercise. 11.30 <small>A. M.</small> to 1.30 <small>P. M.</small>&mdash;Rowing.
1.30 to about 2.30 <small>P. M.</small>&mdash;Running, rubbed dry and linen
changed.</p>

<p>Dinner, 2.30 to 3 or 3.30 <small>P. M.</small>&mdash;Beef (roast) or mutton,
(boiled mutton occasionally), roast fowl, partridges, or
pheasants (allowed), or venison (nothing better); bread,
puddings occasionally, made of bread, eggs, and milk,
and served with preserved fruits. Vegetables&mdash;Potatoes
(one or two only), cauliflowers and broccoli (only as
an occasional change). Old ale, from a pint to a pint and a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
half; wine, a glass or two, port or sherry. After dinner,
until 5 or 6 <small>P. M.</small>, a gentle stroll. Rowing 6 to 7 <small>P. M.</small></p>

<p>Supper, 8 <small>P. M.</small>&mdash;Oatmeal porridge, with dry toast, or
chop, with glass of port. Bed at 9 or 10 <small>P. M.</small></p>

<p><i>Summary</i>: sleep, ten or eleven hours; exercise, say four
hours (exclusive of billiards, etc.); diet, varied.</p>

<h3>WINGATE’S SYSTEM FOR A MONTH’S TRAINING.</h3>

<p>Rise at about 7 <small>A. M.</small> (Glass of cold water recommended).
The crew meet at 7 <small>A. M.</small>, walk and run for four or
five miles; or, in later practice, quick run of two miles.
Wash and dress.</p>

<p>Breakfast, 9 <small>A. M.</small>&mdash;Meat (broiled), bread (brown) and
butter, tea, two cups. Cocoa made of the nibs boiled for
four hours is better than tea for breakfast.</p>

<p>Luncheon at 1 <small>P. M.</small>&mdash;Beef sandwich, with half a pint of
old ale, or biscuit and glass of sherry, or egg in sherry.
At 2.30 <small>P. M.</small> row about four or five miles. This altogether
depends on the state of the crew.</p>

<p>Dinner at 6 <small>P. M.</small>&mdash;Wash in tepid water. Meat (roast,
broiled or boiled). Vegetables&mdash;“The green foods permissible
contain in their list spinach&mdash;the very best of all;
sea-kale, asparagus, but without melted butter; turnip-tops,
young unhearted greens, but not solid cabbages;
broccoli, carrots, parsnips, and cooked celery. Turnips are
also favored, and peas condemned, also cucumbers, and all
salad mixtures. But boiled beet-root is good, and Jerusalem
artichokes; and French beans stand next to spinach
in virtue.” “Any kind of wholesome meat thoroughly
cooked.” The course is varied daily, so that no two days
together shall see the same articles on the table. “Light
puddings may be eaten.” Old ale, one pint. Wine, two
glasses of old port or sherry, or three of claret. Biscuits
and dried fruits, as cherries, figs, etc., allowed. “All fresh
fruits are avoided. Plain jellies are innocuous. As much
spring water as they have a mind to.”</p>

<p>Supper, 9 <small>P. M.</small>&mdash;Oatmeal gruel, if desired. Bed at 10 <small>P. M.</small></p>

<p><i>Summary</i>: sleep, eight or nine hours; exercise, about
three hours; diet, varied.</p>

<h2 id="Training_for_Long_Distance_Contests">TRAINING FOR LONG-DISTANCE GO-AS-YOU-PLEASE
CONTESTS.</h2>

<p>About the first recognized legitimate contest of this kind
was originated by Sir John Astley, a Crimean veteran and
general athlete, giving a valuable gold and silver belt, open
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
to the world, to the one who should cover the greatest distance,
in whatever way he chose, unassisted, on his legs,
for a period of six days. Long distance feats were not in
themselves new, by any means, Capt. Barclay, Foster
Powell, George Wilson, and others in auld lang syne
figured conspicuously in England and Scotland, their journeys
being traveled out of doors, on the roads, similar
to the long walks of Weston, Sergeant Bates, Wm. Gale,
and others. The athletic mania, which had lain dormant
for so many years, was suddenly revived in this country,
and spread like an epidemic far and wide, bringing with
it a healthy reaction. The saloons and viler resorts began
to lose caste for the running and walking match. Street
cars and stages, and elevated railways complained of lack
of patronage on fine days, as old and young, rich and poor,
fell into the walking rage, and amateur spurts from home
to place of business and <i>vice versa</i> became visible on every
few blocks. Even the working girls caught the health imparting
habit, and stepped out as jauntily and with as
much snap as your La Chappelle or Fannie Edwards.
Dailies, weeklies and monthlies saw increased interest and
patronage by devoting space to athletics, while Beecher,
Talmage, Moody, and other lesser lights mixed athletics
up with their dogmas, until at the present time it is the
fashion, and with us style is everything. True, druggists,
doctors and undertakers found their business falling off,
but we are candid enough to admit feeling pleased at this
state of things, as, from being looked upon as a nation of
tobacco-chewing, nervous, dried-up, money worshipers,
experience has proved that Americans now, instead of following,
take the lead in everything worth speaking about.</p>

<p>It is not every boy or man who will make a Rowell, an
O’Leary, a Blower Brown, a Frank Hart, or whoever happens
to be the head of the class when this meets the reader’s
eye&mdash;neither must a young lady expect to become a Madame
Anderson, a May Marshall, or a Von Berg. Both
sexes can, if they have the will, in time, accomplish
what now seems an utter impossibility. Does any
one suppose that Daniel O’Leary walked his square heel-and-toe
contests, Madame Anderson her great accomplishments,
Captain Webb his swimming across the English
Channel, Ed. Hanlan conquering all the world as an oarsman,
by saying “I can’t,” and making no further effort?
To become adept at anything, perseverance is the keystone,
as “Little by little great oaks from small acorns grow,” and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
constant dripping even wears stones away, so that “if at
first you don’t succeed, try, try, try again.” If necessary,
commence by walking only a block at a time, Madame Anderson
used to tell her lady admirers, increasing to two,
four, eight, and so on, doubling and doubling until it will
be found as easy to go miles as it was before the length of
a single row of houses. Youth is the best time for
practice, and the smallest, sickliest looking boy or girl will,
with one or two companions, manage to cover an amount of
ground that would make ordinary grown-up people very
much inclined to doubt, and very loth to attempt. The
youth has ambition in this direction, not having yet got
into politics, money worshiping or being addicted to chewing,
smoking, drinking, etc., which to many men are considered
absolutely necessary. A party of boys with jackets
on their arms will walk and run eight or ten miles, on a
Fourth of July day, cutting up, prattling away, whistling
or singing, with no other refreshment than a little water or
fruit. They fix upon a certain place to go to, may be an
orchard, or to hunt bird’s nests, or to a place to swim, row
or fish, and get there, whereas a man or party of men, unless
conveyed straight to the spot, would probably consume
half a dozen lagers at least, and smoke as many bad
cigars, pipesfull of strong tobacco, or chew a paper of so-called
solace. We have tried both, and found out we
could travel twice the distance on a few oranges or a
mouthful or two of spring water, a biscuit or sandwich,
than all the lager or tobacco taken in our life.</p>

<p>Presuming the individual to be in good health, the walks,
trots, or runs must be gradual at first, and increased daily,
not exactly in the order laid down in previous chapters,
for the six-day business is more a trial of endurance than
speed. It is not necessary to measure the distance between
meals, but keep on the go until pretty well tired,
rest at intervals, then buckle to again. The “Rowell trot”
won him the belt and drew a $50,000 gate, his share the
first time he came to New York, after all expenses being
over $20,000. It has been proved beyond all argument that
trotting or running beats walking, and when once acquired
the dog trot will come as easy to a man (if not easier) as a
fast walking gait. In practicing long-distance running,
style is nothing&mdash;wind and freshness everything&mdash;let your
arms, therefore, swing easy which ever way comes most
natural, as the legs are the motors for this kind of work.
Neither attempt long or short strides, no matter what your
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
gait, clumsy or otherwise, for it is the distance to be got
over that will land you a winner, not your shape or traveling
on your “pretty,” however people may criticise. An old car-horse
will keep up the same jog-trot nearly all day apparently
undistressed, while a terrible three-mile dash at full speed
will perhaps use the fast horse up. It was not natural for
the car-horse to go that gait at first, but he was broke to it,
and men are pretty much like horses in this respect, except
that they can endure more in the long run. You will doubtless
have “bellows to mend,” stitches in your side, etc., but
stick it out and they will not come again probably twice the
same day. A short stick, easy-fitting clothes, light head
cover, well-seasoned and easy fitting laced-up shoes, seamless,
woolen stockings, and a cheerful companion are all necessary.
If troubled with sore feet the pedestrian should follow
Dr. Parks’ advice to the British Army, viz.: Before
setting out dip the feet for a minute or two in very hot
water, wipe them quite dry, and then rub them with soap
(soft soap is best) till there is a good lather; then put on
the stockings. If, notwithstanding, they are yet foot-sore,
at the end of the day wipe the feet with a damp cloth, and
rub them with a mixture of tallow and spirits of wine. Besides
this, great attention should be paid to the stockings,
which should be constantly washed. Worsted and merino
stockings are preferable to cotton ones.</p>

<p>If thirsty, one or two oranges will quench that, and be
most agreeable to the stomach, as well as being of more
benefit than anything else. When in-doors, light dumb-bells
and the skipping-rope may be used vigorously to improve
the wind, but nothing heavy or too violent, as in this
branch of athletics the muscles to be controlled are those
of the legs instead of the arms; change of flannels, socks,
shoes, a salt water sponge-bath, rub down; then apply a
little bay rum, mouth rinsed out, and a pleasant chat with a
friend will make you feel like a new man, and after meals,
before alluded to, ready and willing to tackle hard work
again. If the pedestrian’s appetite falls off, whether from
nervousness, sleeplessness or whatever causes, a preparation
of iron and gentian may be taken, say a teaspoonful
about ten minutes before eating, until his natural appetite
returns, when it should be discontinued. If, on the other
hand, the food taken does not digest readily, and symptoms
of dyspepsia follow eating, then a tablespoonful of
wine of pepsin a quarter of an hour after meals will soon
bring that trouble over, discontinuing when it does. When
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
sickness at the stomach succeeds, a tablespoonful of prepared
lime water, taken in a little milk, when the feeling
comes on, acts like a charm. When the bowels are lax,
thickened flour and milk are good. If costive, rhubarb preserves,
or prune tea, or a mild injection of soap and warm
water will be found to answer every purpose.</p>

<p>Some enterprising Knight of St. Crispin, with a view to
increase their trade by working on the feelings of pedestrians
and others, introduced the old-fashioned piece of
steel under the instep, between the welt and the sole, and
designated them spring walking-shoes, for which there used
to be quite a demand. Experience, however, has proved
that the only spring likely to lead to the winning-post is
what nature gave, and that all artificial appendages are
more likely to do harm than good. The shoe best adapted
for a walker of from one to ten miles is a low-cut shoe, laced
nearly to the toe, with low heel, broad instep and plenty of
room for the toes, and light as possible and of the best
seasoned leather. Ordinary shoemakers can no more
make professional running or walking shoes than an ordinary
blacksmith can turn out a razor or set of chicken-gaffs,
and, therefore, the business should be entrusted to
those who make a specialty of it.</p>

<p>The most successful and tractable of modern pedestrians,
Charles Rowell, has made more money in his two six-days’
contests in New York than he would have in fifty years at a
trade or in his own country. Here we are carried away
with almost anything of an international character, both press
and public. When Rowell made his 500 miles in the first
visit and 524 on his second, it was generally conceded that
he performed the distance on the square, and hence the
patronage bestowed. Other six-day contests have been given
with nearly 40 more miles tacked on to the winner ahead of
Rowell’s time by the black-board, but the receipts were as
quarters to dollars in comparison. There appears to be a
weakness for figures not altogether warranted by the financial
results at the end of the week.</p>

<p>To all, therefore, who compete in long distances for
love or money, do not worry about the score, but <i>keep ahead
all the time</i>. A gain of ten miles on the first day, when honestly
made, and with the intention of staying on the track
through the competition, will be pretty sure to find the leader
far enough ahead to carry off the lion’s share, for, as the veteran
Jack Goulding’s logic proves, if there is a dollar at the
end of every mile it is surprising how many miles a man
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
will go. The practice of the crack flyers competing on the
first day, with no idea of going the week more by preconcert,
may suit the betting ring and the book-makers, but
it has hurt the business more than can ever be patched up
again by the most adroit, self-interested parties.</p>

<p>In addition to Rowell, Brown, Hazael and others have
been brought out, but they either went wrong or could not
be managed by their trainers. Self-reliance is very well, but
an ungovernable temper or dissipated habits are sure to be
left behind when opposed to tractability and abstemiousness.
The English peds used to say there were lots of better men
than Rowell over there, but John Astley knew he was unapproachable
and as honest as they make them, and, whether
the best or not, he carried off the belt against all competitors.</p>

<p>The advantage of an intelligent, capable trainer cannot be
over-estimated, and, one who can satisfy his protege of his superiority
in his business, as well as a man of nerve, is what is
required. When Dan Donnelly, the champion pugilist of
Ireland, was trained by Capt. Kelly for his fight with George
Cooper, he was in magnificent condition, but when he met
Tom Oliver, having had men to look after him whom he
considered only his equal or perhaps inferior, he was in no
condition at all. We are of the opinion that John Ennis
but for James Cusick would never have got second place
to Rowell, or Nick Murphy, Steve Brodie, Hart, Panchot,
etc., made the time they did but for men of superior qualification.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to the young athletes to know the
length of time taken for rest by the six-day men, and therefore
supply this information so as to be easy of reference.
We allude to the contest from April 5th to 10th, 1880,
inclusive: Hart, 23 hours 2 minutes 59 seconds; Pegram, 31
hours 30 minutes 53 seconds; Howard, 30 hours, 50 minutes
39 seconds; Dobler, 22 hours 37 minutes 12 seconds;
Allen, 34 hours 24 minutes 49 seconds; Krohne, 27 hours
18 minutes 15 seconds; Williams, 28 hours 52 minutes 33
seconds, and Hanwaker, 27 hours 58 minutes 21 seconds.
Hart’s actual time on the course was 118 hours 20 minutes
and 1 second, and his average walk in that time was at the
rate of 4 7-10 miles per hour.</p>

<p>Rowell’s regular food when on a six-days march is beefsteak,
chops, bread, vegetables, tea and coffee; occasionally
he takes a little pudding and cheese. Guyon feeds on beef
tea, chops, potatoes, toast, tea and coffee, but no stimulants.
Weston, beef tea, custard, lime water and tea, beefsteak
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
and no stimulants. Ennis, oatmeal, beef tea, rare beef and
oysters. Hazael, chops, steaks, crackers, toast and lemon
soda. Merritt feeds on jellies, fruits, beef, mutton and vegetables,
with tea and coffee. Hart eats chops, chopped eggs,
toast, corn bread, tea and coffee.</p>

<h2 id="Training_for_Base_Ball">TRAINING FOR BASEBALL.</h2>

<p>It is well known that an athlete desirous of excelling in
any special sport or game must be trained only to the extent
to suit the requirements of the sport he desires to
become an expert in. To train young men in a gymnasium
alike for rowing, running or for field work in baseball,
cricket or lacrosse, putting them through the same routine
of exercises, is simply to unnecessarily overwork them for
one particular sport, and to give them insufficient exercise
for another. Of course, to a certain extent, all kinds of
gymnastic exercises, if moderately engaged in, tend to
develop a healthful physique, if gone through with under
the rules of an intelligent system; but the indiscriminate
way in which baseball players enter a gymnasium and go
through with what they call their training is ofttimes
worse than useless work in preparing them to sustain the
fatigue incident to their game. What is necessary for a
baseball player in gymnastic exercise is to take only that
exercise which makes him agile and quick of movement,
and which trains the eye to judge the ball, or the arms and
chest to wield the bat, or the legs to run the bases. Lifting
heavy weights or exercise which is calculated to develop
strength for such purposes is useless. Swinging
clubs, if carried to excess; jumping is unnecessary; work
on the parallel bars, the trapeze, etc., is needless. In fact, a
ball player can find far better training for quick movements,
gaining keen sightedness and endurance in a handball
or racket court than is possible in a gymnasium. Exercise
in short-distance running is good, and all exercises
which tend to strengthen the muscles of the ankles&mdash;such
as skating, for instance&mdash;help to train a ball player. But
what is particularly required in the system of training for
professional ball players is that very activity which handball
yields. This game strengthens the hands, trains the
sight, and especially gives a player endurance in the very
fatigue he has to undergo on the ballfield. A skillful handball
player, when he be comes accustomed to baseball field
work, will always excel in picking up hard-hit ground balls.</p>

<h2 id="Advice_to_Business_Men_and_others">ADVICE TO BUSINESS MEN AND OTHERS.</h2>

<p>The majority of our readers are doubtless young men
having in view perfecting their frames for some muscular
feat, and the bulk of this work was written principally for
their benefit. There is still another and larger class for
whom no author seems to have troubled his head about.
We allude to those compelled by circumstances to spend
their time in sedentary occupations, and are not likely to
get time or means to pursue a regular course of training.</p>

<p>It would be simply ridiculous to advise a letter-carrier to
take exercise after going his rounds of forty or fifty miles
a day, as physicians sometimes do without being aware of
the calling of their patient, or to suggest fasting forty days
and nights for dyspepsia because Dr. Tanner did it, giving
no impossibilities or absurdities, but such as we are willing
to practice and carry out. As a general thing, to keep down
flesh, if inclined to corpulency, avoid sugar, salmon, eels,
herrings, pork, potatoes, beer, bread, butter, milk, champagne,
port and anything calculated to create bile. It
would be well to dispense with fat meats, eggs, pastry,
new bread, cheese and whatever else may produce nausea
or indigestion after eating.</p>

<p>Before making your morning toilet, a sponge saturated in
tepid salt water should be applied to all parts of the body,
and then rubbed dry with a Turkish towel. If too much
of a shock to the system, apply a flesh-brush or the palm
of your hands vigorously to the skin, after which the
sponge bath, and when dry the brush or hand, as before.
When the shower-bath is used, and a person feels exhilarated
from its effects, it is better than the sponge bath; but
when it produces a shiver or weakness, it should be discontinued
until strong enough to indulge in this great summer
luxury.</p>

<p>The mere fact that millions of human beings are strong
and healthy upon a purely vegetable diet should of itself
suggest that, although animal food, as more concentrated,
and yielding more force with less expenditure in its digestion,
is superior to vegetable food, yet there is excellent nutriment
to be extracted from vegetables. The anatomical indications
of man, being omnivorous, should also point in
the same direction, and the need of vegetable acids, no
less than the advantages of variety, at once disclose the
error of banishing vegetable food. The chief mistake lies
in the cooking. The water in which green vegetables are
cooked is poisonous. There is not one house in fifty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
where the vegetables are not cooked in small vessels, containing
very little water, which is never <i>changed</i>, and where
the greens are sent to table with the water properly
squeezed from them. Let any person unable to eat broccoli,
or greens cooked in a quart of water, try the effect of
having them cooked in a gallon of water, or of having the
quart changed three or four times during the process, and he
will soon discover the difference. If potatoes are “watery,”
it is because they are ill-cooked. No Irishwoman serves up
watery potatoes.</p>

<p>Veal and pork are rigidly excluded by the trainer, which
some will hear it with amazement, and will ask how it
was that the ancients gave the athletes nothing but pork.
Would the old hen be thought nutritious, and the chicken
injurious? Would the sheep be tender, and the lamb
tough? And why is the calf to be blooded, and the ox
not? Yet, so long as this practice continues, no one should
indulge in veal, unless his digestion be vigorous. Fried
dishes, rich gravies and pastry should also be avoided, because
of their tendency to develop fatty acids in the
stomach. Some cannot endure fat; others cannot get on
without it. Some cannot touch mutton; others are made
ill by eggs. Let each find out his own idiosyncrasy. The
only thing the trainer teaches us is to take abundant exercise
in the open air, and to be simple and moderate in our
diet, with regularity in hours. If neither time nor strength
permits our abundant exercise, and if our avocations prevent
regularity, what remains but moderation in diet?</p>

<p>The effects of exercise are two-fold: on the one hand a
stimulus is given to the action of the heart and lungs,
which enables the blood to be more thoroughly oxygenated
and more rapidly circulated; on the other hand, there is
an expenditure force, accompanying the increased activity
of the organic changes. Exercise strengthens the parts exercised,
because it increases the nutrition of those parts.
When any organ is inactive, the circulation in it becomes
less and less, the smaller ramifications of its network of
blood vessels are empty or but half filled, the streams gradually
run in fewer channels, and the organ, ceasing to be
thoroughly nourished, wastes away. When the organ is
active all its vessels are filled; all the vital changes, on
which depend its growth and power, proceed rapidly. The
force expended is renewed, unless the expenditure has
been excessive, in which case there is a disturbance of the
mechanism, and depression or disease results. But unless
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
there has been excess, we see that the great advantage of
exercise consists in keeping up a due equalization of the
circulation, an equable distribution of nutrition to the various
organs. Perfect health means the equable activity
of all the functions; not the vigor of the muscular system
alone, nor of the nervous system alone; not the activity
of this gland or that, but the equable vigor of all. Remember
that when life makes great demands upon the
muscular energy, the demands upon the brain must be
less; and when the demands upon the brain are energetic,
there is less force disposable for muscles and glands.
The advantage of exercise to a student or any other
brain-worker, is that it <i>lessens</i> the over-stimulus of his
brain, distributes the blood more equably, calling to his
muscles some of those streams which would impetuously
be rushing through his brain. And understanding
what this advantage is, he should be careful to avail himself
of it; but he should be careful to remember at the
same time that within certain limits all the force with
drawn by his muscles is withdrawn from the brain or some
other organ. He must not burn the candle at both ends.</p>

<p>It is certain that sedentary men, and men of hard-worked
intellects, are greatly in need of some means of distributing
the circulation through the muscles. Exercise is the means.
When the avocations are such as to render continuous exercise
in the open air difficult or impossible, we should
seek to compensate for this by variety of gentle activities
distributed throughout the day. No error is more common
than that of supposing open-air exercise to be indispensable
to health: we may have no time for walking,
rowing, riding or any of the ordinary modes of out-door
activity, yet&mdash;as the excellent health and strength of domestic
servants, who scarcely ever stir out, will show&mdash;the mere
activity of the body, in various occupations, suffices for the
equalization of the circulation. Let the sedentary stand
as well as sit, changing the posture frequently, and using
back and arms as variously as possible. A variety of gentle
activities is more beneficial to the student than bursts
of violent exercise. Above all things, remember that in
exercise, as in diet, the grand rule is moderation. Avoid
fatigue; as you would cease eating when appetite abates,
cease muscular activity when the impulse to continue it
abates.</p>

<p>In general, the healthy man may eat almost anything
in moderation; but it is wiser for all to avoid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
meat twice cooked, rich gravies and fried dishes. Nature
tells us very plainly that that pleasure is a means
no less than an end. The exercise which has in it the element
of amusement is ten times as beneficial as a listless
walk; and the meal which is eaten with a relish is far more
nutritious than a meal eaten only as a periodical necessity.
Solitary walks along familiar or uninteresting roads, or solitary
meals on dishes unstimulating to the palate, are not to
be compared with rambles through interesting tracts, or
with stimulating companions, and meals where the guests,
no less than dishes, add their pleasurable excitement.</p>

<p>There is one point of regimen to which attention may be
called, and that is, never to attempt severe mental or bodily
labor after a full meal. If possible, let all such labor be
got through in the early part of the day, after breakfast,
but before dinner; not only because the bodily vigor is
then greatest, but also because the restoration of that vigor
through dinner should not be interfered with. We know
that in many cases this advice is impracticable. Night-work
is inevitable in some lives, and is fancied to be so in
the lives of students and literary men. In such cases, there
is, at least, this mitigating resource&mdash;not to commence hard
work until the labor of digestion is over. Thousands ruin
their digestion by disregarding this simple advice. If
work after dinner be inevitable, let the dinner be a very
light one, and let a light supper be eaten.</p>

<p>In order to prove the facts above cited, a physician of
our acquaintance tried the experiment upon two healthy
dogs. They were both fed alike and in similar quantities,
one being allowed to rest in quiet an hour after feeding,
and the other permitted to run around and frolic for a
similar length of time. Both dogs were then killed, and
the food of the one allowed to rest was quite digested, while
that of the other was scarcely digested at all.</p>

<p>No better general advice can be given in conclusion than
that furnished us by the greatest physician of the present
time, Dr. Willard Parker, now enjoying rugged health at
the advanced age of eighty, and being a living example of
the truth of his reasoning.</p>

<p>The blood will be either good or bad, according as the
material or food is good or bad. The character of blood
made depends on the kind of food taken. In this country,
as a rule, too much meat is eaten; meat once a day is sufficient,
especially for brain workers. The waste matter
from a meat diet is eliminated through the kidneys. Too
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
much labor thrown upon those organs produces disease.
An overloaded stomach is unfavorable to active brain work.
Man is like an engine with two service pipes, one for the
brain and one for the body, and no man has the requisite
force to work both at once. Generally Americans bolt their
food. It should be cooked. The first process of cooking a
steak is on the range; the second is in the mouth, and this
is done by working the saliva into the food by chewing.
Thus is the food prepared to be acted upon by the juices of
the stomach. Infants in nursing move the jaws to obtain
the milk, and the working of the infant’s jaw mixes the
milk with the saliva, and thus fits that milk to go into the
stomach. After being subjected to the action of the stomach
for two or three hours the food becomes fitted to pass
into the circulation by absorption. To have good food,
therefore, it is necessary that it be made of proper material
properly prepared. We are furnished with milk to start
with as we enter the world. Had meat been the best diet,
we should have been born with beefsteaks in our hands.
But we are given milk. Milk and blood are nearer alike
than any other two fluids; a large proportion of each is
water. After milk, breadstuffs and vegetables are the best
diet, and in warm climates fruit. Then meats. Sugar and
fat go into the body not so much to nourish it as to be a fuel
to give it warmth. Meat contains much nitrogenous matter.</p>

<p>A limited quantity of spirits at the principal meal, especially
for persons advanced in life or of weak digestion,
may aid in the combustion of the food. Spirits aid digestion
in feeble and aged persons; but only the feeble or the
aged require such a stimulus. The young and vigorous do
not need it, and are better off without it. Middle aged
persons may perhaps drink a little spirit with their meals
without danger; but they cannot safely make it a beverage.
In small quantities alcoholic drinks stimulate, and if not
enough is taken to coagulate the pepsin and the albumen
in the food they promote digestion in proper cases, and thus
help to repair the system. But whenever more alcoholic
liquor is taken into the stomach with the food than is demanded
it passes into the circulation, disturbs the action
of the heart, flushes the face and confuses the brain. When
so much fermented or distilled liquor is taken into the system
that the functions of the organism are disturbed positive
harm is done&mdash;the system has been so far poisoned.
An irritation has been set up instead of the desired healthful
stimulation of the stomach.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span></p>

<p>The human system contains water, fat, starch, sugar, nitrogenous
substances, iron, sulphur, phosphorus, animal quinine,
sodium potassium and chlorine; but no alcohol is
found. It has no like in the system, hence there is nothing
that it can repair, and it cannot, therefore, be ranked as a
food of any kind. It possesses an inherent deleterious
property, which, when introduced into the system, is capable
of destroying life, and it has its place with arsenic,
belladonna, prussic acid and opium. Like these, it is to be
employed as a medicine, and has its true position in works
on materia medica. It is both a poison and a medicine.</p>

<p>It has been settled by science that alcohol, which passes
into the blood when more is taken than can be employed
as a condiment or tonic, undergoes no change in the blood,
but exists there as a foreign substance, creating irritation;
and the excitement involved in the effort to throw off the
irritating substance wastes the energy and life of the system.
After alcohol has produced disease of the stomach it next
expends its force upon the neighboring organs, inducing
disease of the liver and dropsy or Bright’s disease, both of
which are fatal to health, if not to life.</p>

<p>The life insurance companies understand it. Their
figures show that while a temperate young man at twenty
may reasonably look forward to forty-four years and two
months of life, the young man of the same age who poisons
his system with drink can expect not more than fifteen
years and six months. He who uses alcohol becomes an
easy prey of epidemics; his system cannot resist the poison
of diphtheria, cholera and fevers.</p>

<p>To make good blood we require good food, pure water,
pure air, sunlight and exercise. Either foul air or impure
water poisons the blood. If you don’t throw off two pounds
and three-quarters of effete matter every twenty-four hours
through the lungs and two pounds through the pores you
must expect sooner or later to fall. Nothing is more essential
than pure air. Impure air is the source of our ship
fevers.</p>

<p>Cleanliness has been classed as akin to godliness. It certainly
takes high rank in equalizing the circulation. The
jockeys appreciate its importance. How regularly and carefully
they groom their horses! Is not man as precious as
the horse? Every man should groom himself every morning&mdash;sponge
himself from head to foot with water of the
temperature of the room in which he sleeps. The purpose
of wetting the surface is merely to make the friction of a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
rough towel more effective as it is rubbed over the person.
You should not sleep in any garment that you wear by day,
and the room in which you sleep should be perfectly ventilated
by a fireplace and a partly opened window if possible.</p>

<p>If, after you have observed the rules of hygiene to the
extent indicated you have cold feet and limbs and indigestion
and a tendency to vertigo, plunge your feet into water
as hot as you can bear it, and keep them there five minutes.
Then put them into cold water for a second.</p>

<p>“Cool head, free bowels, warm feet and a good-salary”
is the old aphorism. If you suffer your feet to get cold
you are in danger of apoplexy of the brain or of the
lungs. Cold feet are very likely to be associated with a
sluggish state of the bowels. The feet are cold because
there is too much blood in one place and too little in another.
Cold feet follow the breaking of an equilibrium of
the circulation. Sedentary occupations are provocative
of cold feet. If you keep the skin clean and the bowels
free and take moderate exercise you will maintain an equilibrium
of circulation, and this equalized circulation will keep
the feet warm. When the feet are cold it is better to warm
them with exercise than at a fire. Look at the wood chopper,
swinging his arms so that his hands slap his sides.
Thus he carries the blood to his hands, and it warms them.
That is the best warmth for either. There is a vast difference
between the longevity of men who take care of themselves
and of those who do not. It is, as the life insurance
companies’ tables show, as thirty-five is to about seventy.
The man who bows to all the known laws of hygiene not
only lives longer, but is able also to enter into all the joys
of life without the aches and pains.</p>

<h2 id="The_late_John_Morrisseys_Views">THE LATE JOHN MORRISSEY’S VIEWS.</h2>

<p>The Honorable John Morrissey, ex-champion pugilist of
America, in conversation with us about diet, said:</p>

<p>“Mr. James, you can form no idea of the glorious feeling
that a man experiences when he gets himself in perfect
condition. Everything in the world looks different to him
from what it does when his system is clogged up with bile,
and he is carrying a quantity of flesh that is only a burden
to him. It is almost impossible to get a man when in such
a condition into a bad humor. He feels like a young colt,
and wants to kick up his heels and have a good time with
everybody and everything he meets.” His course of training
was as follows:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">First.</span> Take a black draught. Any druggist will put it
up. All prize-fighters take this when they begin to train
for a fight. You’ll find it the liveliest dose of medicine you
ever took.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second.</span> Be sure and get at least seven or eight hours of
good sound sleep every day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Third.</span> In the morning when you first get up drink a
glass of hard cider with a raw egg in it. If the cider is
not to be had then use sherry wine, but I prefer the cider.
Then start out and walk briskly for a couple of miles.
When you come back take a sponge bath and rub yourself
dry with a coarse towel. Bub until your skin is all aglow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fourth.</span> For breakfast eat a lean steak, cooked rare, and
stale bread. Use no milk, no sugar, no butter, and no potatoes,
with the exception of about once a week. If you
wish you can eat a roast or baked potato in the morning.
Drink sparingly of tea and coffee. Tea is the best.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fifth.</span> For dinner eat rare roast beef and stale bread.
Use no potatoes or vegetables of any kind with this meal.
For change you can have occasionally a mutton chop.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sixth.</span> For supper, a lean steak or a mutton chop, without
fat. Do not eat any warm biscuits or warm bread, at
any time. Stick to good wholesome stale wheat bread.
Eat no pies, cakes or pastry of any kind, and use pepper,
salt and all other seasonings very sparingly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Seventh.</span> Use no stimulants of any kind. Do not smoke.
Drink sparingly of water. Do not eat berries or vegetables
of any kind, excepting occasionally a raw onion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eighth.</span> If you feel weak in the morning before breakfast,
it comes from the bathing, and it should be discontinued
for a few days.</p>

<p>The system for hardening the muscles, etc., most approved
of by the Senator and the leading pugilists, is being
first sponged with a decoction of arnica flowers, alum, borax
and Jamaica rum, then bathed with hartshorn liniment,
and an application of white wine vinegar mixed with alum
and borax to the face and hands. The proportions of the
ingredients used in the sponge bath have hitherto been a
profound secret with the professional trainer. For the
benefit of the fraternity we here print them: Take two
pounds of arnica flowers, five cents’ worth of borax, five
cents’ worth of alum, and steep all together, after pulverizing
the alum and borax, in a gallon or so of Jamaica rum,
and after letting it steep for twenty-four hours, apply as
before stated.

<h2 id="Training_in_Regard_to_Pugilism_and_Wrestling">TRAINING IN REGARD TO PUGILISM
AND WRESTLING.</h2>

<p>The work necessary to reduce or otherwise bring the
pugilist into something like condition will be, of course,
nearly if not precisely similar to the training required for
a pedestrian or other match. The physicing will require
great attention; all drastic and griping medicines are to be
avoided, if possible, and cases will occur from time to time
where no medicine ought to be given whatever. The man
in one of these instances will be in a low state, and require
feeding and training up. In another, the body will be in
so open and relaxed a state that the prescribing and giving
the usual dose would be followed to a certainty by the
patient training right off, and failing into a low and prostrate
condition. In the general state of health, however,
which characterizes the pugilist when matched to fight
(with a full habit of body, flushed countenance, and a pulse
full and slow), the usual dose, salts, etc., may be introduced
with advantage, but the quantities and frequent use left to
the usual habit of the man, or to the judgment of the
trainer. The physicing and preparation for the hard work
should occupy the first week; and the number of sweats
taken during the second week should be regulated by the
state of inside and the loose flesh on the body. A sharp
run will soon show the state of the inside by the state of
“the bellows,” whether the wind is short or not, and the
manner in which the looser flesh shakes when sparring is a
pretty fair criterion of there being a good quantity of outside
superfluity to get away. He ought to be rubbed down
after his runs and fast walks, and dry clothes put on in a
warm, dry room. The loss of weight should be gradual.
If, on the contrary, the loss be too rapid, and continue
daily, the reducing system must cease, and feeding up take
the place of sweating for a few days until the system is
restored. The meals, of course, must be taken regularly,
and consist of the same kind of animal food as recommended
previously, and the beverage most suited to the
constitution of the man taken in small quantities&mdash;the kind
and quantity, of course, being left to the judgment of the
trainer. Wine is principally given when the man has to be
trained up, and then good old port wine will be found to
be of the most service. The pugilists of the present day
strengthen the arms, loins, and shoulders by hitting out at
a striking-bag suspended from a beam, and a large bladder
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
hung in like manner; by exercise with pulleys, the ropes
passing over wheels and having weights attached; plenty of
practice with the gloves, diversified with the use of a skipping-rope,
and finally, but by no means of minor importance,
by continual sharp practice with dumb-bells of about seven
pounds weight or under. Good condition in the pugilist will
be shown by the healthy state of the skin, which will be clear,
with a ruddy tinge underneath, as well as soft, with the
muscles underneath swelling and feeling firm to the touch
at every movement of the limb or portion under manipulation.
The eye will be clear and bright, and a look of
confidence and ease of mind characterize the expression
and looks of the athlete. As regards the pickle for the
hands and face, the nostrums for the first are legion, and
one as good as another; but we believe that nothing is
better than the simple juice of a lemon for the latter, and
which will be found to answer every intended purpose.</p>

<p>The trainer ought to be chosen with regard to his
conversational powers, as well as for his knowledge of what
is requisite for the physical health of his pupil, that he
may amuse and instruct him to the fullest extent of his
power. The trainer should inform him, if possible, of all
the peculiarities of the antagonist, his mode of attack and
method of defense, the weak points of his temper, or any
physical deficiency under which he might labor, as well
as the manner in which he may have won or lost any
previous battle. And, as in many cases the first or second
telling may not have the effect of raising the curiosity of
his man, the patience of the trainer should not give way
under the repetition before the slow and obtuse curiosity is
roused to such an extent that the pugilist commences the
interrogation in his turn, and becomes anxious in his inquiries
for information, which will almost invariably be the
case when he finds out the importance that the trainer’s
continued repetitions have invested the apparent trifles
with.</p>

<p><img src="images/hr.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="Principal_Muscles_used_by_the_Athlete">PRINCIPAL MUSCLES USED BY THE ATHLETE.</h2>

<p>In high jumping, the front muscles of the thigh are principally
used. They are attached at one end to the top part
of the thigh bone, at the ocher to the knee cap, which
passes over the knee, and is fixed to the top part of the
shin bone. In the act of jumping, these muscles contract
violently, and straighten the leg with a jerk, the quickness
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
of which mainly contributes to the height of the
jump.</p>

<p>In long jumping, the muscles of the back part of the
thigh are used; these are attached to the back part of the
shin bone at one end, and to the lower part of the pelvis
at the other, and by contracting draw the leg backwards
on the trunk. This action is also assisted by the glutœus
maximus, which is fixed at one end of the top part of the
thigh, at the other to the lowest part of the vertebral
column.</p>

<p>In long distance running, the front and back muscles of
the thigh are used in equal proportions; the former in
raising the body at every stride, the latter in propelling it
forward. But in the case of running on the toes, the calf
of the leg will be the weak part; so much so that no
amount of practice will enable some, especially heavy men,
to run any distance on their toes.</p>

<p>In short distance running, the front muscles of the thigh
which lie nearest to the trunk, bring the leg forward in
the rapid repetition of the strides. These are a different
set from those that straighten the leg, and are used in
long distance running; they are attached at one end to the
lower and front part of the pelvis, and at the other end to
the top part of the thigh bone. The back muscles of the
thigh are the same that are used in long distance running
for propelling the body forwards. A narrow pelvis is a
great assistance in this, as indeed in all running; for on
the narrowness of the pelvis facility in repeating the strides
principally depends.</p>

<p>In throwing the hammer, more depends on the swing
than on the strength of any particular muscle, though the
strain comes more particularly on the small of the back&mdash;that
is, on the muscles which raise and keep the back
erect, and are attached to all the vertebra of the spine.</p>

<p>In putting the stone, the muscles called particularly into
action are the front part of the deltoid, which is attached
to the top part of the arm, and at the other end to the
collar bone, and brings the arm upwards and forwards; the
top part of the pectoral muscle, which also runs from the
top of the arm to the collar bone, and brings the arm forwards;
the triceps, which is fixed at one end of the shoulder
and shoulder blade, and at the other end of the forearm,
below the elbow, and extends the arm at the elbow
joint. The feet are also assisted by a simultaneous spring
with the legs, and a rapid turn of the body.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span></p>

<p>In walking, the muscles of the whole body are brought
into action more than in any of the other exercises we
have alluded to. The arms and back assist the legs greatly
in changing the balance of the body, and in bringing the
hips forward at each stride. The calf of the leg has much
work to do, even as much as running on the toes. The
muscle, however, that suffers most is that which rises on
the outside of the shin bone, near the knee, and runs down
the leg, crossing the shin near the ankle, to be inserted
near the inside of the sole of the foot. This muscle raises
the foot, and draws it back towards the leg at the end of
the stride, and also points the heel at the commencement;
so that in fast walking it has no rest, and consequently
becomes very painful. The front and back muscles of the
thigh also come in for a large share of work.</p>

<p>The following measurements are an average of the
dimensions of some of the best runners, and may be taken
as a fair guide of what the proportion of the limbs should
be respectively:</p>

<p>The dimensions of the chest may appear small at first
sight, but it must be remembered that the runner has no
muscles of the shoulder blades to increase his measurement.
A well-made runner has not that top-heavy appearance
that characterizes the gymnast who does much arm
work.</p>

<h2 id="Temperament">TEMPERAMENT.</h2>

<p>The Sanguine Temperament belongs to that class with
bright, ruddy complexion, light hair, and full circulation.
Their disposition is energetic and spirited, but their power
of resisting disease or of bearing protracted exercise is
not great, and their ardent character is rather the result of
nervous excitability than of vital force. Their power lies
in dash rather than in endurance.</p>

<p>The Bilious Temperament is of an opposite description.
The circulation is sluggish, the disposition persevering
and obstinate; the constitution as a rule is tough, and is
capable of severe tasks, under which the sanguine would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
succumb. These men are good subjects for training, but
they require good food and much exercise.</p>

<p>The Lymphatic are of a pale complexion, with delicate
skins and full habit of body. There is a torpor about their
mental as well as muscular actions. When subject to disease
they become peevish and are difficult to treat. When
united to a nervous disposition, they are perhaps the worst
class of men for training, though we sometimes find much
latent energy in them. To a certain extent, nervousness is
overcome by habit; but the nutrition of the nerve power
ought to be the main point in the advancement of health.
The nerves are the controllers of the actions; they regulate
the contraction of muscles in the activity of the body. The
work done by the muscles depends on the proper adjustment
of the mechanism, their guidance and activity on the
energy of the nerves. The important work that the nerves
fulfill is evident, when we consider that the brain itself needs
one fifth of the whole supply of the blood in the body. It
must suffer, therefore, if the supply of air to the blood is
bad. How easily is accounted for the dull aching of the
temples of the athlete accustomed to pure air in a badly
ventilated theatre or room. If deficient oxidation of the
blood is the cause of derangement to the nervous system,
blood of bad quality must be equally hurtful to the muscular.
The sensibilities of the internal organs are the disposition
of each person to such a degree as to be influenced
by the slightest sensation of pain, joy, grief, or any feeling
of the mind. The reaction affects the muscular system; all
the functions of body are carried on by a system of self
and mutual help, so intimately united together as to be dependent
for proficiency on one another.</p>

<p><img src="images/hr.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="Growth_and_Decay">GROWTH AND DECAY.</h2>

<p>The food after mastication by the teeth, and solution by
the action of the saliva, gastric and other juices, is taken
up by a system of vessels, and, mingling with the venous
blood, is carried to the heart, whence it is sent to the lungs to
be aerated, and back again by another set of vessels to the
heart, to be finally pumped through the arteries to all
parts of the body, carrying materials for the repair of the
tissue, and production of heat. In the very minute terminations
of the capillary arteries in those structures, where
the molecular change of the body goes on, the current of
the blood is very slow, to enable the warmth and sustenance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
of the body to be kept up by the chemical actions of
destruction and reproduction of tissue. The oxygen in the
arterial blood obtained from the lungs is carried throughout
the system and assists these actions, therefore perfect
respiration and pure air are the great promoters of change
of tissue. This shows the necessity of the blood being in
a sufficiently liquid state to hold gases and nutritive matter
in solution for the purposes of oxydizing tissue and
of forming flesh. The amount of water in the blood determines
to a great extent the health of the body, the blood
being the organ of the vital processes of change. The
severe restrictions on liquid imposed on those in training,
who by arduous exercise waste much tissue and need much
repair, are, therefore, physiologically wrong. The action of
the air on the skin stimulates the secretion, and exercise, indirectly
raising the heat of the body, induces perspiration,
which is nature’s remedy to keep the temperature of the
body constant. Evaporation and secretion require water.
On a daily average, 2lb. of water is thrown off by the skin
in moderate exercise. Water forms 70 per cent. of the
whole body, and for the digestive fluids the proportion of
water to solid is as 12 to 1. Liquidity is necessary, also,
for the actual processes of decay and repair, by causing the
passage of fluids of different densities through the various
animal membranes from the oxydation of venous blood in
the moist air of the lung cells to the repair of tissue by the
smallest capillary in the extremities.</p>

<p>Want of liquid causes a stagnation of the circulation, an
inflammatory state of the body, and excites the nervous
system to an extraordinary degree. Owing to this want,
under the usual system of training regimen, the body is
frequently in a state of fever about the second week, until
either the trainee gives up the preparation, or his constitution
has temporarily accommodated itself to the change at
the expense of his vital energy.</p>

<p>The nourishment of the body by the food taken is important
in its regard to health, and its variety. The primary
object of food is to form blood, and according to the
condition in which the body receives it, greater or less nutriment,
at the same expense of vital activity, can be obtained.
The assistance of nature, by proper cooking and
careful selection of articles, is in our own hands. Our
vegetables should be well cooked, and the animal food
ought to be done so as to retain the juices of the meat.
Let it be rather under than overdone. Brown meat is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
more nutritious than white. If the digestion is good, the
athlete need not be particular as to description of food.
Rich sauces are not to be recommended, or even heavy puddings,
but jellies and light ones are most acceptable. A
healthy, robust man, in hard work, may eat nearly anything
in moderation. The food should be well masticated, to enable
the saliva to dissolve the starchy matter in it, and also
to prevent a sudden loading of the stomach. The blood
during digestion is principally employed about the stomach.
Exercise or mental work, therefore, directly after a
meal, will retard the operation of digestion by taking away
the blood to the limbs or brain.</p>

<p>Great mental activity requires much repose. In the
winter more sleep is required than in the summer, from the
fact that the activity of the system, in keeping up its
warmth, etc., though of shorter duration, is greater. Sleep
after food is often required by nervous persons of weak
digestion, but the athlete is better without it, an amusing
book, light study, etc., taking its place. A mattress gives
the soundest sleep. The quantity of clothing should be
sufficient to keep up a gentle exhalation from the skin.
The wasting of the body to reduce weight is frequently
carried to a ridiculous extent. It has been proved that the
body in daily work loses about 1-24th of its weight, and
that life ceases when the waste has reduced it to 3-5ths
of its original weight. In the nerves, however, the loss
is hardly perceptible; while the fat suffers in double
the proportion of the muscles, 90 and 45 per cent. respectively.</p>

<p>This may well explain the nervous excitability of the
body when kept beyond its regular time for food, or when
supplied with food of deficient quality. The arrangement
of the internal mechanism must go on, respiration continues,
circulation and heat result, at the expense of the machine
itself. By regularity in meals the stomach accommodates
itself to the changes of action and repose, and the system
harmonizes with it.</p>

<p><img src="images/hr.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="Meats_etc_to_be_Avoided">MEATS, ETC., TO BE AVOIDED.</h2>

<p>Veal, pork, and salt beef or bacon should be avoided; also
goose, duck, and wildfowl generally; as well as butter,
cucumbers, sweets, and all seasonings, except salt with a
little black pepper. Venery should not be indulged in
under any circumstances while training.

<h2 id="Natural_Sweating">NATURAL SWEATING.</h2>

<p>Put on extra clothing over those parts more particularly
which are loaded with fat. Thus, if the legs are very fat,
two or three pair of trowsers should be drawn on; if the
abdomen is full, then a double apron of flannel should be
suspended from the neck under the trowsers; and if the
arms and neck are loaded, two or three thick undershirts
may be worn, and a woolen shawl wrapped round the
neck. When thus clothed, a brisk walk or a slow run of
two or three miles brings on a profuse perspiration, which
may be kept up for an hour or so by being covered with
blankets, or by lying in front of a good fire; the clothes
should be then stripped off, beginning with the upper part
of the body, and sponging each with hot salt water, before
drying it with a coarse towel, after which horse-hair
gloves should be used freely. The dressing may be as
usual, taking care to expose each limb as short a time as
possible.</p>

<p><img src="images/hr.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="Artificial_Sweating">ARTIFICIAL SWEATING.</h2>

<p>Take a Turkish bath, or the whole body should be stripped
and immediately wrapped in a sheet wrung out of cold
water, but not so as to get rid of all the water; then, rolling
the patient in a thick blanket, inclosing the arms, like
a mummy, he is placed beneath a feather bed, covering all
up to the chin. In a quarter of an hour or so reaction
comes on, and a most profuse perspiration breaks out over
the whole body. When the sweating has continued from
an hour to an hour and a half, everything should be taken
off, and cold water poured over the whole body by means
of a shower bath; then rub dry and clothe.</p>

<p><img src="images/hr.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="Sweating_Liquors">SWEATING LIQUORS.</h2>

<p>A scruple of Dover’s powder at night, or half a pint of

should be taken to rub the whole body with horse-hair
gloves night and morning.</p>

<h2 id="Treatment_of_the_Feet_Hands_Sinews_etc">TREATMENT OF THE FEET, HANDS, SINEWS, <span class="smcap">Etc.</span></h2>

<p>The chief cause of tender feet rests with the socks and
shoes or boots in which the pedestrian may commence his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
work. By no means attempt work in new boots, or in
those, however well seasoned, that are not of sufficient
length and width in the tread and across the toes. The
thickness, so as they are of a sound double sole and
perfectly water-tight at the lower part, does not so much
matter; but a few days’ use will soon prove to the training
man that a rather stout pair will keep his feet sounder and
be of more comfort to him, in a long journey, than the
lighter kind, Different men, however, are of various
opinions; but Westhall, during a long experience, found
that a pair of boots laced up the front and reaching a trifle
above the ankle and of medium stoutness, answered every
purpose required by anyone who is satisfied with doing
well. A very thick pair, of course, may be kept in reserve
for very wet and muddy weather, when slow work only will
be advisable to be taken. Should the pedestrian, however, be
obstinate, and take fast work in the heavy boots, he will in
most cases be punished by sore shins, which will prove a
source of such trouble that the lighter sort of boots will be
in requisition for the future. The socks should be of an
easy fit and of fine warm lambs’-wool. The chief care
about the socks, however, is taking the precaution that a
pair of socks should never be worn a second time until
thoroughly aired, and if possible a supply should be so
provided that they may be rinsed out in cold water, and
then dried before again being worn.</p>

<p>The above precautions will prove of the greatest value to
those who have feet given to sweating, and in some
instances have proved an effectual cure for the inconvenience.
The toenails should be attended to regularly,
and the shape of the foot will be the best criterion for their
treatment. To prevent the hands from swelling, a short
stick or switch, carried in the hand will be efficacious while
walking about. Strains are of frequent occurrence, and
chiefly arise from the man making some sudden effort when
the tendons or the fascia (the thin covering) of the muscles
are stiff and sore from previous hard work. The tendon
Achilles&mdash;from the heel to the calf of the leg&mdash;is the
principal seat of the most dangerous of the strains of the
tendons, and is incurable except by rest, and that of some
duration. Should there be any swelling and hardening of
the injured portion of the tendon, <i>do not</i> attempt any
methods of self-treatment, but seek <i>medical</i> advice. All
strains are assisted in their cure by bandaging, but they
should not be applied until hot fomentations for some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
time have been applied, and finished up by the application
of the embrocation, with plenty of friction, before
a fire.</p>

skin; also bathe in strong salt water mixed with powdered
alum and vinegar. If large, run a stocking-needle threaded
with white worsted through; then cut the end off, leaving
the worsted in the blister until the water runs out. Do
not leave off washing the feet in salt water, etc., as this
will act as a preventative.</h2>

<h2 id="Exercise_Sun_Baths_etc">EXERCISE, SUN BATHS, ETC.</h2>

<p>The increasing interest in the matter of healthy exercise is
shown by the number of athletic clubs and gymnasiums
throughout the country, especially so in our colleges of learning
and public institutions. Most of these have every gymnastic
appliance, as also professors to give instruction; but
where such do not exist a complete outfit at a very moderate
expense can be obtained, all ready for use. The rowing
machine has been previously described. The health lift, as
a gentle exercise, is rapidly becoming an institution of
necessity to persons of sedentary habits, and brings into
action, when properly used, as many muscles of the human
frame as any other exercise, and yet consumes but a few
moments of time daily, which of itself is an important item
to brain-workers and industrious humanity generally. It
is so adjustable as to be alike suited for the weakest,
strongest, shortest and tallest persons of either sex. Indian
clubs, dumb-bells, trapeze bar and rings and striking bag
may all be readily obtained, and, simpler still for in-door
exercise, Goodyear’s Patent Parlor Gymnasium, which can
be used by ladies and children without any fear of strain
or the slightest jar to the system. Dr. Dio Lewis, in his
work on New Gymnastics, gives a series of movements and
illustrations without the aid of any auxiliaries, so that there
can be no possible excuse for neglecting exercise. Sun and
air baths, involving no expense, can always be had. By these
we mean exposing the body naked a certain portion of the
day to their effects. It was the custom of John Quincy
Adams to walk up and down his bedroom nude, and with
open windows as a preventative of colds. This he practiced
both winter and summer, with the desired effect, living to
be over eighty. With a view still more to the assistance
and preservation of nature, General Pleasanton has written
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
an elaborate work, claiming wonderful effects in nervous
diseases from the sun’s rays as reflected through blue glass
panes, and his theory is extensively practiced with very
encouraging results. Dr. Samuel R. Elliott of this city, an
athlete as well as a very skillful physician and scientist,
has found that in some cases the blue glass alone produces
too strong an effect, and believes that alternate blue and
white strips, two or three inches wide, engender the proper
form and quantity of electricity; and we therefore suggest
that his plan be adopted. The patient should sit for an
hour or more daily in such position that, whatever part of
the body is affected, may be acted upon by the rays thus
received. Where advice can be had it is better to obtain
it, as all persons cannot even take electricity in the same
manner, quantity or proportion. The glass should not be
colored on the surface alone, but through and through, of
a deep mazarine hue.</p>

<p><img src="images/hr.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="Baths_Hot_Cold_etc">BATHS&mdash;HOT, COLD, ETC.</h2>

<p>The use of water cannot be too much applied to any
athlete as regards outward application, but of course cold
is the most beneficial if the constitution of the recipient be
of sufficient vigor; and there are but very few indeed who
are so delicate as to require tepid or warm water; but even
the latter are better than the absence, even partially, of the
bath. Cold baths may be taken anyhow and anywhere,
provided the whole of the body is immersed or thoroughly
sponged over, but the most decided benefit will be derived
from the plunge bath. However, equally successful results
may be gained by the use of a large bath well filled with
water, the body being well sluiced with the water from a
large sponge. The shower is also of great benefit, but in
some conditions of body the sudden shock has rendered
the nervous system so irritable that it has undone all the
good intended by the reaction. Where there is not the
convenience of a bath of any kind, a towel dipped in water
and the body thoroughly and briskly rubbed will insure a
thorough cleansing of the pores of the skin, and of course
a proportionate share of vigor given to the frame. In the
present system of training, the pedestrian puts on his
sweaters and does the work set him by his trainer, and
then, when he is in a state of perfect perspiration, he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
throws off his wet and reeking flannels, and takes his
shower with the greatest unconcern, knowing that the
friction which is afterwards applied will restore the proper
heat of the body after the sudden shock of the shower
has closed the pores of the skin for the time and relieved
him of all his previous fatigue. The rubbing restores the
circulation of the small blood-vessels of the skin, and so
strong and fresh do the pedestrians feel after this treatment
that, when dressed, they all declare they feel no
remains of their previous fatigue. Nothing but good has
accrued from the treatment, and those who have undergone
a trial of the sweat and shower swear by the
method.</p>

<p>The Turkish bath is only fit to reduce an infirm and
obese man to something like weight to begin work, and
can only be looked upon as a luxury, and not an adjunct
to training, besides being far from healthy. The hot bath
is of course required when a man is stiff and tired all over
from cold or overfatigue, when they will modify the symptoms;
but, as they are so simple and so easily obtainable,
they require no further comment. A vapor bath is of
considerable use in assisting a healthy and fat man to
reduce his weight; but after sweating he must be rubbed
with a wet cloth, or have a shower; he should then put on
a set or two of flannels, and do at least an hour of severe
work, during which time the reducing process will be
going on in perfection. On arriving home the wet towel
should be applied, or a sponging with cold water; after
a good rub, and fresh clothing being donned, it will
be found there has been a good morning’s work accomplished.</p>

<p>The vapor bath can be made in a very home-spun and
simple manner, but equally efficacious with those attached
to baths of large name, etc. A washing or any other flat
tub, a third filled with very hot water, in which is placed
a stool, will do for the ground-work of the vapor. Take
your seat on the stool, the feet of course outside the tub,
and be well covered with blankets round the neck, and
round the tub, leaving an opening which can be closed at
leisure. Having heated two or three large bricks to a red
heat, put one into the water, and when cooled another,
until the bath has been prolonged a sufficient time. This
is a primitive but a very useful bath to put into use to
relieve a bad cold, or for any other service required at a
short notice.

<h2 id="Thirst_Medicine_etc">THIRST, MEDICINE, ETC.</h2>

<p>The chief punishment when a man is in the course of
training requisite to reduce his bulk is thirst, which is in
most cases of rather a severe character. The same amount
of pluck which enables the man to go through his work
and adhere to other rules must be here called into requisition.
The best plan is to gargle the mouth, but not
swallow any; but the application of cold water will be
found to afford the greatest relief&mdash;washing the hands,
wrists, and face freely will give relief; a little pebble kept
in the mouth is a very good thing, but faithfully avoid all
nostrums such as cream of tartar, tartaric acid, etc., when
suffering from thirst, as they only gratify the palate without
relieving the craving for liquid immediately the acid
taste has passed, when the before troublesome feeling
becomes much augmented. Should relief, however, become
imperative, a small portion of powdered nitre will be followed
by an immediate flow of saliva, which will give instant
but unfortunately only partial ease. There, however,
is no increase of the symptoms from the application of the
remedy, which will assist the action of the kidneys, and
allay the accompanying fever of the system. The chief
cure is to wait until the next meal-time, when the previous
abstinence from stolen enjoyment will be rewarded by an
approving conscience in having resisted a severe temptation.
The thirst will leave a man when he leaves off
sweating.</p>

<h2 id="Banting_on_Corpulency">BANTING ON CORPULENCY.</h2>

<p>The system of reducing corpulency as adopted by William
Banting, an old retired merchant of London, England, in
1863-4, by the advice and direction of Doctor William
Harvey, of Soho square, in that city, though not by any
means admissible or advisable for training purposes, we
give the substance for the benefit of any one who feels
interested. At the time Mr. Banting commenced his reducing
system he was sixty-six years of age, weighed 202 pounds,
standing only 5ft. 5in. in height, and, having spent seven
years in consultation with the greatest medical lights of
England for relief of his affliction, but in vain. He had
followed an active business life of fifty years, and attributed
his obesity not to neglect of necessary bodily activity nor
from excessive eating, drinking, or self-indulgence of any
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
kind, except that he partook of simple aliments of bread,
milk, butter, beer, sugar, and potatoes more freely than his
aged nature required, and hence he believes the generation
of the parasite, detrimental to comfort, if not really to
health. He tried both rowing before breakfast for two hours
and other bodily exercises; also sea air and bathing in
various localities; took gallons of physic and liqure potassae,
rode much on horseback, and tried the waters and climate
of various springs in England, as well as Turkish and vapor
baths, shampooing, etc. Banting could not stoop to tie his
shoe, had to walk backwards down stairs to save the jar of
increased weight upon the ankle and knee-joints, puffed
and blowed at every exertion, particularly going up stairs,
suffered from an umbilical rupture, had to wear a truss as
well as knee bandages, his sight failed and hearing became
impaired, he had indigestion, heartburn, palpitation of the
heart, and could not attend to the little offices which
humanity required without considerable pain and difficulty,
which only the corpulent man can understand.</p>

<p>Upon consulting Dr. Harvey, previously alluded to, he
was told that all his ailments were caused principally by
corpulence, and prescribed a certain diet, no medicine beyond
a morning cordial as a corrective, with immense effect
and advantage both to his hearing and the decrease of his
corpulence. The items from which he was advised to
abstain as much as possible were bread, butter, milk, sugar,
parsnips, beet root, turnips, carrots, champagne, port, beer
and potatoes, on account of their containing starch or
saccharine matter, tending to create fat; smoking was not
prohibited. This is the diet prescribed by Doctor Harvey:
for breakfast, four or five ounces of beef, mutton, kidneys,
broiled fish, bacon, or cold meat of any kind except pork,
owing to its fattening character; or veal, on account of its
indigestible quality; a large cup of tea (without milk or
sugar), a little biscuit, or one ounce of dry toast; for dinner,
five or six ounces of any fish except salmon, herrings
and eels (owing to their oily nature); any meat except pork
or veal; any vegetable except potato, parsnips, beet root,
turnips or carrots; one ounce of dry toast, fruit out of a
pudding, any kind of poultry or game, and two or three
glasses of good claret, sherry, or madeira; for tea, two or
three ounces of fruit, a rusk or two, and a cup of tea without
milk or sugar; for supper, three or four ounces of
meat, or fish, similar to dinner, with a glass or two of
claret&mdash;night-cap, if required, a tumbler of grog (gin,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
whiskey, or brandy, without sugar) or a glass or two of
claret or sherry. Eggs, if not hard boiled, are unexceptionable;
also cheese, if sparingly used, and plain boiled
rice.</p>

<p>On rising in the morning, between six and seven,
Banting took a tablespoonful of a special corrective
cordial, not aperient, and partook of solids and liquids
as follows: about five or six ounces solid and eight of
liquid for breakfast; eight ounces of solid and eight
ounces of liquid for dinner; three ounces of solid and
eight of liquid for tea; four ounces of solid and six
ounces of liquid for supper and the grog afterwards. He
took his meals as follows: breakfast between eight and
nine; dinner between one and two; tea between five and
six; supper at nine. His former dietary table was bread
and milk for breakfast, or a pint of tea with plenty of milk
and sugar, and buttered toast; meat, beer, much bread,
and pastry for dinner; the tea similar to that of breakfast,
and generally a fruit tart or bread and milk for supper.</p>

<p>His girth during that time was reduced round the waist
12&frac14; inches; these desiderati were attained by the most
easy and comfortable means, with but little medicine, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
almost entirely by a system of diet. At the end of one
year Banting asserts that he was restored in health, both
bodily and mentally, had more muscular vigor, ate and
drank with a good appetite, and slept well; all symptoms
of acidity, indigestion and heartburn vanished; he left off
using boot-hooks and other such aids, which were before
indispensable; he lost all feeling of occasional faintness;
left off knee-bandages, which he had worn for twenty
years, and gave up a truss almost entirely.</p>

<p>Corpulence, says Banting, though giving no actual pain,
must naturally press with undue violence upon the bodily
viscera, driving one part upon another, and stopping the
free action of all.</p>

<p>Saccharine matter is the great moving cause of fatty
corpulence, producing increased weight and a large amount
of flatulence; stouty matter is not so troublesome as saccharine,
which largely increased acidity as well as fat.
Pure genuine bread may be the staff of life, as it is termed;
it is so, particularly in youth, but it is decidedly more
wholesome in advanced life when it is thoroughly toasted.
Any starchy or saccharine matter tends to the disease of
corpulence in advanced life, whether it be swallowed in
that form or generated in the stomach; that all things
tending to these elements should be avoided, of course
always under sound medical authority. Vegetables, and
ripe or stewed fruit, are generally ample aperients. The
dietary system only attacks the superfluous deposit of fat,
and purges the blood, rendering it more pure and healthy,
strengthens the muscles and bodily viscera, and sweetens
life, if it does not prolong it.</p>

extracts:</p>

<p>“Here we have in condensed form a vast amount of valuable information
upon a subject which should deeply interest everybody,
the substance of numerous other foreign and domestic publications
on like subjects mingling with impressions and advice born of the
author’s observation and practical experience. A treatise on the
muscular system, tables showing the correct measurements of noted
athletes and proportions of a perfect human figure, with remarkable
feats of strength, etc., are also given. It is written in language clear
to the understanding, and is a work which we can cheerfully recommend
all to read, confident that no one can peruse it without profit
to themselves.”&mdash;NEW YORK CLIPPER.</p>

work will immensely benefit everyone, it giving the cream
of the best authorities upon everything concerned in its title.”&mdash;PHILADELPHIA

<p>“Richly deserving of perusal. The work is not intended for professional
athletes exclusively, but for all who desire to enjoy perfect
physical health, which can only be acquired and retained by a proper
regard for the laws of nature. Mr. James thoroughly understands
the subjects of which he writes, and presents them in a straightforward,
attractive manner. The book deserves to be widely read, and
its teachings, if followed, will do more than doctors’ prescriptions
toward preserving health.”&mdash;NEW YORK HERALD.</p>

<p>“It is filled with useful hints and practical suggestions.”&mdash;UTICA

<p>“Of incalculable benefit to the health of many who are suffering

<h3>NEW YORK HERALD.</h3>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Treatise on Practical Training.</span>”&mdash;At a season of the year when most needed
<span class="smcap">Edwin James’</span> “Treatise on Practical Training” has appeared. This neatly gotten-up
book is full of valuable hints to athletes of whatever kind and character, having
been compiled with rare judgment, which long years of laborious work in
the sporting world has given its author. The unpretentious volume, among other
things, contains useful chapters on Training for Rowing, Boxing, Wrestling, and
Pedestrianism, in addition to instructions for High and Broad Jumping, Fair
Walking, Hammer-throwing, and in fact everything else useful to the professional
or amateur athlete.</p>

<h3>NEW YORK CLIPPER.</h3>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Treatise on Practical Training.</span>”&mdash;A new friend, and a most welcome one to
all devoted to the pursuit of athletic exercises, has just made its appearance in the
form of a neatly gotten-up book bearing the above title. It has been compiled
with care and good judgment by <span class="smcap">Ed. James</span>. In addition to the useful chapters on
Training for Pedestrianism, Rowing, Boxing, Wrestling, etc., the book contains
instructions in regard to practice for High and Broad Jumping, Running, Fair
Walking, Hammer-throwing, Hurdling, and Putting the Stone, and tells what to do
in case of accident, tender feet and hands, boils, etc. “Banting’s System of
Reducing Corpulency,” a Table of Proportional Measurements according to Height
and Weight, and Records of Best Performances are also included.</p>

<h3>NEW YORK SUN.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Ed. James</span> has just published an edition of his “Practical Training for
Running, Walking, Rowing, and Wrestling,” embracing “Banting’s System of
Reducing Corpulency.” It is an excellent work.</p>

<h3>NEW YORK SPIRIT OF THE TIMES.</h3>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Treatise on Practical Training.</span>”&mdash;The well-known sporting author, <span class="smcap">Ed. James</span>,
has just published a “Treatise on Practical Training,” which gives an immense
amount of condensed practical information, valuable to lovers of athletics and all
kinds of sports, besides containing important Tables of Statistics, revised up to
January, 1877.</p>

<h3>NEW YORK SUNDAY DISPATCH.</h3>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Treatise on Practical Training.</span>”&mdash;The celebrated sporting writer, <span class="smcap">Mr. Ed.
James</span>, has just issued a “Treatise on Practical Training,” which we can confidently
recommend to every amateur and professional athlete in the land. It contains
minute instructions as to the method of training for races, walking-matches,
wrestling, pugilism, jumping, stone and hammer throwing, and sports of every kind,
beside a fund of useful record matter concerning time, weight, conditions, etc.</p>

<h3>NEW YORK CLIPPER.</h3>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Manual of Sporting Rules.</span>”&mdash;This is the title of a work issued by <span class="smcap">Mr. Ed.
James</span>. It contains rules regulating Trap-shooting, Cocking Contests, Boat-racing,
Prize Ring, Wrestling (different styles), Running, Walking, Jumping, Bagatelle,
Lacrosse, Quoits, Rifle and Pistol Shooting, Archery, Shuffleboard, Shinny, Rackets,
Handball, Swimming, Pin-pool, Fifteen-ball Pool, Skittles, Foot-ball, Knurr-and-spell,
Scottish Games, Ten Pins, Skating, Curling, Fly-casting, Polo, etc. Heretofore
where rules were in existence they could be procured only through private
sources, or separately; but we now have them in such shape as will meet all demands.
In many instances there were no rules, but the publisher has, by consultation
with the leading exponents of the several games, combined with his own
intimate knowledge of sporting matters, been enabled to supply such wants in a
satisfactory manner. The volume is illustrated with engravings representing
various games. The work should command a steady sale.</p>

<h3>TURF, FIELD AND FARM.</h3>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Manual of Sporting Rules.</span>”&mdash;A very complete work, comprising the latest and
best authenticated revised rules governing all the various games played and practiced

<p>This machine gives an excellent
and exact representation
of rowing. It has the
sliding-seat movement, and its
propelling action is with oars
(as in a boat). It is simple in
construction and durable, and
it packs so small that it can be
stowed away in almost any
cupboard or closet, and can be
put up and worked in any
ordinary-sized bed room. Total
weight, 27℔. A beginner can
learn on it to be a good sculler, as well as increase his muscular and
physical development. By shifting the chain links attached to the lever
it can be adapted to the strength of any person, or used and worked by
a child 12 years of age. Price, complete and ready for use, $10.</p>

<p>The front link prevents the
operators from falling forward and
enables them to spring from the
toe, and can walk up a steep incline,
turn round and run down.
The back check is to prevent falling
backward; also to enable the
operator to stop at will in case of
danger. Can be used any place.
Enables learners to use them
without danger of falling and
hurting themselves, which is very
common with other skates. The
wheels being of iron, are warranted.

<p>This skate is neater, lighter, and more
durable than any skate yet offered. The
foot-plate is of sheet-iron, with mountings
(well secured) which will not cause pain
or injury to the feet. The axle runs
through a steel collar upon which the
wheel revolves, thereby preventing friction.
The roller is made of solid vulcanized
rubber, and will not become soft or
peel off when in use.</p>

<p>In constructing this skate, no new or
untried mechanical principle for obtaining
the desired motions and power is employed.
The transverse sliding clamp for
grasping the sole, operated and held by
means of pins and slots, is a mechanical
device long and successfully employed on
skates; which, with the single and directly
acting heel clamp and longitudinal
screw, make this the most desirable of all
clamp skate in the market. All of the
important parts of these skates are made
of steel; and the runners are manufactured
of the best welded steel and iron,
carefully tempered.</p>

<p>The patent consists mainly in the application
of an entirely new style of screw
and clamp, the latter catching upon the
metal hoop, and the screw passing through
it and into a solid ash rim, forming for
itself a thread almost as durable as one
of metal, and producing an equal and
powerful pressure upon the flesh hoop.</p>

<p>The advantages of this banjo over all
former patents are many, and comprise,
mainly, a power of tone never before attained
in a low-priced banjo; extreme
lightness, durability, and an attractive
appearance, which assures the dealer of
a ready sale.</p>

<p>On <small>ALL</small> these Banjos we use the best
quality French calf head, Italian strings,
and thoroughly seasoned wood for the
necks and rims.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
